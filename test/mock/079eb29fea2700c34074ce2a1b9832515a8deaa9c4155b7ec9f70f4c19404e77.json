These plants are a permanent record of regional flora, especially for the remaining tallgrass prairie in the Flint Hills of Kansas. Our mission is to document this biodiversity and to maintain the tradition of providing knowledgeable identification of plant specimens for students, scientists, and the general public.",

These counts are underestimated because they were made over a decade ago and the majority of the collection holdings have not been identified nor cataloged. The estimated minimal numbers are: Pinned Insects about 1 million individuals, Med/Vet Zoology about 75,000, Arachnids under 50,000, Miscellaneous groups under 1,000. At least 3 million specimens are retained as sealed, bulk specimens. These samples are mostly cataloged and are being split and labeled as time permits (motivated by researchersÂ needs). There are currently slightly more than 800 type specimens (mostly paratypes) in the collection.",

The collection is 90% freshwater species (mussels, fingernail clams, and snails) and 10% terrestrial species (snails). Most of the specimens were collected as a result of various faunal surveys conducted by INHS biologists from the late 1800's until the present. The early collections were made by such naturalists as John W. Powell, Robert Kennicott, Richard E. Call, William A. Nason, Frank C. Baker, Robert E. Richardson, and Charles A. Hart. The snails are divided between terrestrial (13%) and freshwater (5%) species, most of which were collected more than 50 years ago. The largest and best documented collection of snails at the Survey was compiled by Thural D. Foster and organized by Frank C. Baker as part of his study on the \"Landsnails of Illinois\" published in 1939. The Baker snail collection numbers 1632 lots containing 11,970 specimens.",

Taxonomic coverage consists of all avian orders and approximately 85% of avian families. The oldest specimens are from the mid-1870’s, with most collected after the 1950’s. The collection has grown about 6-fold since 1989, and it continues to grow rapidly through salvage and research-driven collecting. Approximately 40% of the specimens have frozen tissues associated with them. Collection highlights include: Synoptic series of the Birds of New Mexico for ID reference and teaching; the personal collection of Dale Zimmerman, donated in 2004, which contributed significantly to the taxonomic and geographic scope of the collection; the collection of Amadeo Rea, upon which the book Once a River was based; raptors and game birds of J.M. Campbell; the J. Stokley Ligon collections (in part); and representative threatened, endangered and extinct species of North America. All but the most recent research specimens are published online via the database Arctos.",

Current holdings comprise approximately 460,000 botanical specimens including many historical specimens dating from the 1800's and early 1900's.  The vascular plant collection (ca. 267,000 specimens) has an excellent representation of the flora of Florida and the southeastern United States, large holdings from the West Indies (esp. Haiti) and other Neotropical areas.  The bryophyte and lichen collections (ca. 120,000 specimens) are worldwide in scope with an excellent representation of species from Florida and tropical areas such as Costa Rica, Venezuela and Brazil. The wood collection (16,000 samples) is worldwide in scope with a excellent representation of tropical woods.  The algal collection includes ca. 2,000 specimens, mainly from Florida.  The Fungal Herbarium contains ca. 55,000 specimens.  The herbarium's collection catalog includes ca. 70,000 specimens, mainly vascular plants, including ca. 1,000 type specimens.  Digital images are available for approximately 40,000 specimens.  Support for the UF herbarium's computerization effort is provided by the Florida Museum of Natural History, UF / Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch Project FLAS-HRB-04170), UF Libraries Digital Library Center, Florida Center for Library Automation, the Florida Museum Associates and the Andrew W.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.\n\nThe museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.",

The Herpetology collection spans 77 countries, with its geographic strength in Mexican and the southwestern United States species. It contains over 68,000 specimens, including over 22,000 from Mexico, which have been actively studied and cited in systematic herpetology publications over recent decades. Additionally, the whiptail lizards (genus <i>Aspidoscelis</i>) are particularly well represented, including over 12,000 fluid-preserved specimens and two hundred dry skulls. The world-renowned herpetologists, Hobart M. Smith and T. Paul Maslin, as well as a number of their students and collaborators, were the major architects of our largest vertebrate collection. R. Earl Olson's contribution of 3,800+ specimens recently expanded our taxonomic and geographic coverage, including new material from Minnesota and Haiti. Most recently, Julio A. Lemos-Espinal contributed 2,600 specimens from the northern Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua, and Coahuila.",

The collection is scientifically valuable for its extensive coverage of this rich and biogeographically complex transitional region. The majority of specimens are fluid-preserved and are accompanied by field notes. There are significant holdings of amphibian eggs and larvae, skeletal preparations, prepared materials, focused collections that show evolutionary dynamics at intraspecific transition zones, and the synoptic collection. We do not maintain a tissue collection at this time.  The CCBER herpetological collection is unique in its thorough coverage of the herpetofauna of southwestern California, and for its relevance to critical conservation issues via documenting life history patterns of declining amphibians and recent changes in the abundance and distribution of species.",

We have a small selection of larval fish from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands maintained in 10% formalin. Our skeletal collection contains 794 cleared and stained fish, as well as 410 dry skeletal preps. Many of the skeletal specimens originate from W. W. Dalquest and his students. We also have a tissue collection currently with over 515 samples preserved in 100% ethanol frozen in liquid nitrogen. Our type collection includes 3 holotypes, 110 paratypes, and 1 allotype. Our holdings were collected between 1927 and present and there was a significant increase in collections during 1950–1980, mainly by Clark Hubbs and his students. In 1993 we acquired the collections of the University of Texas at Austin’s Marine Science Institute, totaling ~ 3,000 lots of ethanol preserved specimens from the Gulf of Mexico. Between 2000 and 2011 we acquired collections of ethanol preserved specimens from Midwestern University, Texas Tech University, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, The University of Texas at Brownsville and Lamar University. We are working on cataloging these specimens, and will make those data available as soon as possible. Our collection is rapidly growing and many of our incoming specimens come from Dean Hendrickson and his students, museum staff, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and various researchers.",

It currently holds over 100,000 specimens with a worldwide distribution, representing all vertebrate classes from the \nSilurian to the Pleistocene. This collection was acquired primarily through over a century of field work by section staff and associates as well as acquisitions by the Museum. Fossil collecting began in 1895 with the sponsorship of \nMr. Andrew Carnegie, who supported the museum’s numerous early expeditions to the American West that resulted in one of the best dinosaur collections in the world. Carnegie in his retirement further strengthened the collection with \nthe purchase in 1903 of a large collection of Paleozoic-Cenozoic, European fossils from the Baron de Bayet, a private fossil collector from Brussels, Belgium. Strengths of the collection include Mississippian fishes from Bear Gulch, \nMontana; Pennsylvanian and Permian fishes, amphibians and reptiles from the tri-state region of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia and the southwestern United States; Jurassic dinosaurs, especially sauropods, from Utah (Dinosaur \nNational Monument) and Wyoming; Jurassic fishes and reptiles from Germany and France; Eocene fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy; Eocene mammals, reptiles, and amphibians from central Wyoming and Utah; Miocene mammals from a site now \npreserved as Agate Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska; and Pleistocene vertebrates from the Appalachian region.",

            "collection_description": "History: The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  See \"A History of Herpetology in Illinois\" for more information on early herpetologists in Illinois. Holdings: The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study \"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,\" published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963). Frozen Tissues: We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above. The search engine will deliver limited location information.",

With the exception of birds, our collections are the largest collections of their kind in Colorado. Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The collection of fishes is primarily preserved in fluid, with some osteological and dried specimens. It contains over 24,000 specimens in roughly 1,900 lots. The majority were collected in Colorado, although there is a worldwide representation of both marine and freshwater species. Many specimens were collected in the early 1900s by Max M. Ellis, including several hundred from Guyana. The collection also includes about 2000 Salmonid specimens donated by Robert J. Behnke, Colorado State University Professor Emeritus and the author of Trout and Salmon of North America. Nearly 10% of our holdings are representatives of endangered and threatened species.",

Additional collections include bryophytes and lichens. The Archbold Biological Station is also known as the Leonard J. Brass Herbarium, named in honor of worldwide plant collector, palm expert, explorer, conservationist, and botanist, L.J. Brass (1900-1971). Dr. Brass founded this herbarium and collected the majority of its specimens. In February 2010, we also dedicated this collection to Dorothy Mundell, in appreciation of her long-time service to the herbarium. Carl Weekley and Rebecca Yahr also made significant contributions to the ABS herbarium. Eric Menges is currently the curator.",

The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.</br></br>\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette & Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region's fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.</br></br>\n\nThe tissue collection comprises tissue samples originally collected in liquid nitrogen, DMSO and ethanol and stored in state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen dewars at -170°C. The tissues are made up mostly of muscle tissue but also includes, liver and other internal organs, fin clips and whole specimens.  A large proportion of our collection has vouchers held either at KU or at other collections.  The provenance of these vouchers is indicated in the database</br></br>",

The egg collection of the WFVZ is the largest in the world.</br></br>\n\nThe Western Foundation’s collections have contributed to multiple scientific fields (e.g., conservation, ecology, taxonomy, and toxicology). For example, the WFVZ provided photocopies of egg records for more than 500 species, and egg measurements for more than 400 species, covered by the Birds of North America series. This information and digital pictures of these eggs and nests are now available at www.birds.cornell.edu/birdsofna.  The Foundation’s egg sets have also figured prominently in studies of eggshell thinning due to contaminants (e.g., DDT and heavy metals). Since 2000 alone, the WFVZ has contributed data to more than 200 publications. Thus, the value of the WFVZ’s collections for science, and for the conservation of bird species, continues to be evidenced.</br></br>\n\nStaff of the WFVZ provide data on eggs, including measurements and digital images, to researchers. Please contact René Corado, Collections Manager, for more information, and see our list of services available to researchers.</br></br>\n\nNests:</br> \nThe Foundation has more than 18,000 specimens from around the world, representing the largest collection of nests in North America and the world.</br></br>\n\nWFVZ pictures of the nests of North American breeding bird species are available at www.birds.cornell.edu/birdsofna, or researchers can contact us for particular digital images.</br></br>\n\nSkins:</br>\nThe WFVZ houses more than 56,000 study skin specimens representing over 100 countries, with the largest numbers of specimens from the United States (>12,900), Mexico (>12,600), Malaysia (>4,400), Costa Rica (>4,000), and Ecuador (>3,800). The skin collection is at least the 16th largest among North American collections.</br></br>\n\nThe primary sources for specimens currently are wildlife rehabilitation organizations; wildlife research agencies; birds killed by cats, window strikes, and car impacts; and the Foundation’s own field research projects.  Materials are consistently acquired by the Western Foundation and used by researchers, educators, scientific artists, and other museums.  In addition, materials are used in educational tours and presentations for the general public, both at the Foundation and at outside events.</br></br>\n\nSkin loans are made to qualified researchers.",

            "collection_description": "The collection of fishes includes over 30,000 catalogued lots representing 34 families, primarily of North American freshwater fishes. Groups best represented are North American minnows (Cyprinidae), catfishes (Ictaluridae), darters (Percidae), sunfishes (Centrarchidae), and suckers (Catostomidae).The collection dates to the 1920’s, with specimens collected by early expeditions of the Museum of Zoology and Department of Zoology under the direction of A. I. Ortenburger. The particular strength of the collection is in its holdings of extensive samples of fishes throughout the lower Great Plains, with emphasis on Oklahoma streams and reservoirs. Periods with strong collecting efforts include the 1920s, 1950s-1960s, and 1980s to the present. The collection grew substantially in recent years with the addition of long-term samples of fish from sites statewide by the late Mr. Jimmie Pigg. We continue to add actively to the holdings of the range by virtue of ongoing research by the curators and their graduate students and by continued archiving of community samples by the Department of Environmental Quality, whose employees continue the work begun by Mr. Pigg.\n\nThe Division of Ichthyology houses the largest and most comprehensive collection of archived specimens of fishes for Oklahoma. These collections comprise an invaluable resource for documenting historical ranges, present distributions, and ecology of Oklahoma fishes. These collections allow analysis of range contraction, human-induced changes, and conservation status of the fish fauna of Oklahoma. The availability of long-term series provides an important opportunity to assess natural variation in fish communities.\n\nThe majority of the collection is in fluid storage in archival museum jars, with limited holdings of larger specimens in steel tanks. In addition, there is a teaching collection that includes cleared and stained material, prepared skeletons, and representatives of the fish fauna world-wide both freshwater and marine.",

Melhus was hired as Iowa State&amp;apos;s first plant pathologist. Two years later, Joseph C. Gilman joined Melhus as a mycologist and plant pathologist.\r\nSubsequent studies of plant diseases, continued through the work of\r\nLois H. Tiffany, who added numerous specimens from Iowa State parks\r\nand preserves. Dr. Tiffany is also responsible for the placement here\r\nof the prestigious University of Iowa Mycological Herbarium when it\r\nwas decided that the collection could no longer be housed at Iowa\r\nCity. This collection contains the specimens of George Martin, Thomas\r\nH. Macbride, and A. P.

We are in the process of databasing our phycology collections. Over 2000 specimens have been entered to date. All specimens will eventually be imaged and made available on this site. Sample images are available for the genus Porphyra. The specimens were discovered in various parts of the Torrey Life Sciences Building during the move to the new combined collections facility. The majority of the collection dates from the latter part of the nineteenth century, starting around the mid 1870’s and is mostly from New England. Specimens range from those collected by eminent phycologists such as Frank Shipley Collins and Isaac Holden to other UConn collectors such as Andrew E. Wheeler, Joanna Page, George Safford Torrey and Frank Trainor. New collections are being added by students from the Biology of Algae course. A small minority of specimens are from Australia, Bahamas, California, Florida and Puerto Rico. Also included are exsiccatae separates from Algae Boreali-Americanae and the Phycotheca Boreali-Americana. Collins, Holden, and Setchell. With an active phycology faculty CONN is interested in exchanging duplicates to add to our collections. Comments on the data and requests to loan the specimens or receive archived high resolution images are welcome. We anticipate completing this project by the end of the year. It is also intended to use this small dataset as a ‘guinea pig’ for further retrospective geo-referencing and mapping projects planned for the main herbarium.

The growth and wide-ranging scope of this collection can be credited to the diverse interests of the systematists who have spent all or part of their career at the Survey. Scientists such as Stephen A. Forbes, the first Director of the State Laboratory and Chief of the Natural History Survey; Theodore Frison, who succeeded Forbes; and H. H. Ross, who directed the intense systematics studies of the faunistic section for 40 years, placed considerable emphasis on enlarging the insect collection. These insects document the changing landscape and environmental conditions of the world.\n\nThe INHS insect collection is one of the largest in North America. The most recent size estimate was done in 1992. The heavy concentration of specimens from the last third of the 1800s also makes this one of North America's oldest insect and related arthropod collections. \n\nThe INHS Insect Collection includes more than 13,000 primary types (syntypes inclusive). Because of size, historical holdings, and wide breadth of coverage in certain groups, the collection is an important national and worldwide resource.",

            "collection_description": "University of Texas at Arlington Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center: During the 1980s the herpetological collection witnessed an explosive session of growth.  Prior to the 1980s the collection contained approximately 8,000 herpetological specimens.  By the end of the decade more than 30,000 specimens were housed in the collection.  During the 1990s the size of the collection increased at an almost exponential rate.  During this time, the collection grew to contain more than 80,000 specimens.  This combined with efforts from  faculty and students helped to establish national and international recognition for the collection.  Since the turn of the century the herpetology collection at the University of Texas at Arlington has experienced more growth and the collection now houses some 115,000 specimens and is among the top herpetological collections in the United States.  In 2004 the entire herpetological collection was moved from the basement of the Life Sciences building to the newly constructed Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center.\n     Asides from housing a major herpetological collection, the Department of Biology at the  University of Texas at Arlington has hosted and facilitated the academic pursuits of a diverse student body.  This has also provided inherent benefits to the museum collection as well.  The collection currently holds the worlds largest assemblage of reptiles and amphibians from Guatemala as well as significant holdings from Texas, Bolivia, Cameroon, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guyana, Honduras, and Mexico.  Along with several thousand fluid preserved specimens, the collection maintains several type specimens, a sizeable osteological collection, cleared and stained specimens, audio recordings of frog calls, one of the largest collections of herpetological photographs in the United States, as well as a comprehensive herpetological library.  These resources can be made available for use by qualified individuals.  For questions regarding the use of the collection resources please call 817-272-2406.",

Field collections of habitats thought to contain tardigrades were made throughout the Long Term Ecological Research Sites  (LTER’s) in the United States from 2007 – 2012.  Other areas, both nationally and internationally were opportunistically sampled.  Samples were processed at Fresno City College with identifications being done by FCC undergraduate students, supervised by Dr. Randy Miller, and Carl Johansson, with DNA being done at BYU on selected samples. Over 15,000 tardigrades were collected and processed during that time.  Slides are distributed between FCC’s Robinson – Winter Museum of Natural History, Bohart Museum, and the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences.",

The Entomology collection contains over 950,000 specimens, with Coleoptera (750,000+ specimens) and Lepidoptera (130,000+ specimens) as primary foci. The holdings include at least 18 primary types and 150 paratypes, and dates of collection span from 1878 to the present. The dung beetle collection is the largest in the United States, and our scarab holdings are particularly strong in African as well as regional material. The Colorado Scarab Survey and the Colorado Microlepidoptera Survey, both long-term projects initiated and conducted by DMNS, are steadily growing our regional holdings and our knowledge of the Colorado fauna. The Arachnology collection, with over 55,000 vials of specimens and specimen lots, is the sixth largest in the United States. Holdings are particularly strong in Colorado species and in Solifugae, with 13 primary types and 65 paratypes. The Colorado Spider Survey, initiated at DMNS and now in its 15th year, has vastly expanded our knowledge of the Colorado spider fauna. At the end of 2014, the Entomology collection moved to a new, state-of-the-art collections facility in the south wing of the museum; the Arachnology collection will be moving to the new facility in 2015.",

In the years following, the next State Botanist, Homer House, and other mycologists added to this number. The collection now contains more than 90,000 specimens. However, the importance of the collection is not in the number of specimens it contains, but, rather, in the type specimens of American fungi collected during the early years of American mycology. It is especially rich in Agarics and other larger fungi. Some of the other collectors represented in the herbarium of the New York State Museum are G. F. Atkinson, M. E. Banning, E. Bartholomew, M. J. Berkeley, E. A. Burt, G. W. Clinton, M. C. Cooke, M. A. Curtis, J. Dearness, J. B. Ellis, W. R. Gerard, E. C. Howe, J. H. Haines, H. W. Harkness, E. W. D. Holway, C. H. Kauffman, W. A. Murrill, P. A. Saccardo, S. J. Smith, and C. J. Sprague. In addition to specimens, the Museum holds numerous original drawings and paintings of fungi by Charles Peck, Mary Banning, and others plus an extensive file of correspondence covering the formative years of American mycology. Non-type specimens are available on loan to recognized scientific institutions for taxonomic research. Requests for samples of type specimens for genetic and morphological analyses are considered on a case-by-case basis.",

Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The geographic scope of our bird specimens is global, representing 38 countries. As in all of our collections, the emphasis is on Colorado species (over 80% represented) with material dating from the early 1800s to the present. Nearly 6,000 specimens were donated by the Colorado College Museum in Colorado Springs in the 1960s. This material includes the collection of Charles E. Aiken, a pioneer ornithologist in Colorado, and dates back to 1805. The Bird collection is also home to several specimens of iconic extinct species such as Passenger Pigeons and Carolina Parakeets.",

Important recent acquisitions include large collections from Duke, North Carolina State, Stockton State, and Western Carolina universities, Mars Hill College, and the University of North Carolina’s Institute of Marine Sciences. The collection houses fluid-preserved specimens, cleared and stained material, skeletons, tissues for molecular analyses, and all supporting legacy data.",

Gilbertson and M. J. Larsen). Based on these collections over 75 systematic papers were published (e.g. Lowe, 1963, 1975; Larsen, 1968). SYRF specimens have not yet been digitized, but the data generated by this project, will be maintained by SYRF using appropriate software. This project will not only create an electronic version of the data stored in the herbarium, but also affords the opportunity for an advanced undergraduate student or graduate student to learn digitization techniques.",

The majority of specimens are eggs and larvae, with 7.7 million specimens in 103,000 lots. There are 380,000 juvenile and adult specimens in 52,000 lots, representing some 4,076 species in 1,386 genera and 328 families.  All specimens are stored in glass jars or stainless steel tanks containing 70% ethanol preservative. Tissue samples are available for over 5000 lots representing 800 species.  There are 38 primary and 318 secondary type specimens in the collection.  Approximately 324 lots of cleared and stained specimens, representing 203 species in 63 families, are also available. These are stored in full strength glycerin and maintained separately from the main collection. These skeletal preparations are augmented by an extensive library of X-rays of North Pacific fishes. Begun in 1981, this library now includes some 765 X-rays, including representatives of 135 species in 66 families. We also have a growing dry skeleton collection, most of which has been donated by local archaeologists wanting to make their reference collections available to the public.",

Many skeletons of birds and mammals have been prepared to accompany the more traditional skin collections. Especially noteworthy are the largest collections of herps and bird eggs in the Northwest and, until very recently, the largest collection of mammals in the Northwest. The bird wing collection is also of special significance, as a fifth of the bird specimens in the collection have been prepared since 1990 and thus have associated wings. Because it contains series of many species of vertebrates from throughout western North America, the Slater is an excellent source of material for the study of geographic variation.",

            "collection_description": "The National Science Foundation has announced a new grant to provide funding for a nationwide, publicly accessible database of mushrooms and related fungi. Including mushrooms, porcini, puffballs, club fungi, conks, morels, stinkhorns, truffles and cup fungi, these organisms play a critical role in the lives of plants and animals, including humans. Some are gastronomical delights, others are deadly poisonous, and all serve as nature’s recyclers, returning nutrients to the soil through decomposition. Scientists in the U.S. have been studying macrofungi for the past 150 years, resulting in a legacy of approximately 1.4 million dried scientific specimens conserved in 35 institutions in 24 states. Through this project, led by Drs. Barbara M. Thiers and Roy E. Halling of The New York Botanical Garden, these treasures will be virtually liberated from their museum cabinets and shared on-line through the Mycology Collections Portal and through many other on-line collections databases such as The Garden’s Virtual Herbarium. The database created by this project will enable a national census of these critically important organisms, and allow researchers to better understand the relationship between macrofungi and other organisms.",

Other states with substantial representation include California, Delaware, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Other countries with substantial representation include Laos, Vietnam, and Gabon, and the international focus of the collection is expanding. Important recent acquisitions include large collections from Duke and Virginia Commonwealth Universities, the University of North Carolina’s Institute of Marine Sciences, and the personal collection of the late E. E. Brown of Davidson College. The collection houses fluid-preserved specimens, skeletons, skins, tissues for molecular analyses, and other materials. Photographic vouchers, field notes, other museums’ records of North Carolina holdings, and specimen data sheets are also maintained as part of the materials documenting these resources.",

            "collection_description": "The University of Kansas Ichthyology collection contains more than 680,000 specimens of fishes from around the world and is the basis of the research and educational activities of the Division of Ichthyology. The collection has an emphasis on freshwater fishes of the central United States and also has significant marine and estuarine collections. The fish collection has representation from 3171 taxa (297 families and 1262 genera) and 79 countries including Ecuador, Fiji, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua and various marine localities. The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.</br></br>\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette & Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region's fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.</br></br>\n\nThe Ichthyology collection comprises whole, wet, voucher specimens in 70% ethanol (98%), specimens maintained as dry skeletons (0.3%) and cleared and stained preparations in glycerine (1.7%). Other ancillary collections include a large slide and digital image collection of specimens and locations (some of which are linked to specimen records through the database), a large field note collection and a map collection.</br></br>\n\nThe wet specimens are housed in a state-of-the-art fluid collection facility, opened in 1996. The facility has 2,400 square feet of collection storage space on four floors and is shared with Herpetology, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Entomology and Invertebrate Zoology. The collection storage environment is maintained at 65°F year-round by an HVAC system. Specimens are housed in state of the art glassware and stainless steel tanks and protected by a sprinkler fire suppression system and UV-shielded lighting. The division has both morphological research facilities and a shared molecular systematic laboratory.",

VSC also provides specimens for use in teaching, and its staff responds to requests from the general public, natural resource managers, agricultural scientists, and others by providing information about plants and service determinations of unknown plants and, where appropriate, preserving vouchers relating to such. In 2009 the Valdosta State University Herbarium established a SQL database, with assistance from the VSU Division of Information Technology, and in 2011 obtained support from the National Science Foundation (DBI 1054366, R. Carter PI) that enabled the purchase of imaging and other digitization equipment and the employment of student assistants to begin capturing images and building a database.  More than 70,000 specimens have been digitized.  In 2012, the Valdosta State University Virtual Herbarium (VSU-VH), a collaborative project between the Herbarium and the VSU Odum Library, was made possible with funding from the Valdosta State University Faculty Research Fund (M. Holt PI, R. Carter Co-PI).  The VSU-VH serves on-line vascular plant specimen images and data, and images and data from more than 4,000 non-vascular plant specimens are served through the Consortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria (CNABH) portal. \n\n\nVSU Virtual Herbarium http://herb.valdosta.edu/ \n\nConsortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria http://bryophyteportal.org/portal/index.php",

Over 75% of the pinned collection has been databased; approximately 10% of the wet collection has been databased. At least one specimen of every lowest identification, in both the pinned and wet collections, has been databased so we have a complete online taxon inventory of the collection. 61,099 specimens have been identified to the species level - these represent 2,354 species (23% are apparent new records for the state).

In addition, a small Ascomycete collection with emphasis on Discomycetes is present. The collection has been a pivotal part of the program of teaching and research in mycology over the past from 1970 through 2005. With the retirement of Dr. Orson K. Miller, the mycological collection entered a static stage in terms of growth. In 2012, the bulk of the collection was transferred to the New York Botanical Garden with 5000 specimens from the Southeastern United States remaining at VPI. Many collections are complemented by fresh notes, color transparencies and black and white negatives. A Microsoft Access database contains nearly 15,000 records, including all specimens currently housed at VPI. The mycological herbarium is participating in the Macrofungi Collections Consortium Digitization Project during 2013-2014 and will be available online at a later date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Prior to being moved to the New York Botanical Garden, the collection contained an estimated 29,500 specimens. Geographical coverage included major collections from Virginia and the Appalachian region, central Idaho and northwestern Montana. In addition, an Alaskan collection numbered more than 6000 with emphasis on arctic and alpine tundra fungi. Major foreign collection were from Europe, Western Australia, Republic of Korea and from The Greater Antilles, especially Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. Additional collections came from Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Thailand. Those interested in consulting specimens from outside the SE United States region should contact the New York Botanical Garden.",

In 1988, at President AltmanÂs direction, the University expanded the Arboretum to include a 5-acre (2.0 ha) Cypress dome, an oak hammock of about 3 acres (1.2 ha), and about 15 acres (6.1 ha) of sand pine and Florida scrub, connected to the original Arboretum by a saw palmetto (Sabal palmetto) community and increasingly rare Florida longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) flatwoods. Currently, the official Arboretum Boundary encompasses approximately 82 acres (33.2 ha). The original Arboretum director was Dr. Henry O. Whittier, a professor in the Biology Department who remained director until his retirement 2003. Dr. Martin Quigley was director from 2003-2009.",

            "collection_description": "The Herpetology Division and its collection of amphibians and reptiles is one of the research units of the Texas Natural History Collections (TNHC) in the Texas Natural Science Center (TNSC) at The University of Texas at Austin. The collection consists of 85,000 cataloged specimens, including skeletons and larvae.  The collection contains 2061 species from 808 genera (95 families).  It is one of the largest regional collections in the southwestern United States, and also has significant holdings from Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The collection is particularly strong in frogs; for example, the worldwide representation of toads (Bufo) compares favorably with collections such as the Smithsonian Institution.  For its size, the collection is also very strong in phrynosomatid lizards and hemidactyline salamanders.\n\nThe TNHC is modestly comprehensive, incorporating all major groups of amphibians and reptiles but lacking numerous families (non North-American taxa).  The major strengths of the collection to date fall into five categories: 1) extensive series from certain parts of the U.S. (e.g., Pseudacris, hemidactyline salamanders), 2) substantial worldwide collections of the genus Bufo, 3) certain historically important and likely irreplaceable specimens (e.g., Blanco Blind Salamander [Eurycea robusta]), 4) deep and dense chronological representation, especially from central Texas and the Texas Panhandle, and 5) over 650 open reel analog tap recordings of frog calls recorded in the field between 1950 and 1983 from various locations around the world.  \n\nOur Texas holdings comprise 56% of the total collection, from 247 of the 254 Texas counties.  We have holdings from 47 other U.S. states (only missing specimens from Maine and Rhode Island) as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands.  Worldwide, we have herpetological holdings from 85 additional countries, including substantial collections from Central and South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Holdings of extinct or extirpated species include Bufo periglenes and specimens of Opheodrys vernalis collected from Texas populations.  Thirty-seven species in the TNHC are stated listed as threatened or endangered, and 18 are federally listed as threatened or endangered.\n\nThe skeletal collection consists of both dry, and cleared & stained skeletal preparations.  There are just under 1000 dry skeletal specimens (mostly Bufonidae) and over 1200 cleared and stained specimens.\n\nThe earliest cataloged herpetology specimens date from 1939 (specimens received in exchange from the University of Florida), with a handful of specimens collected in the early to mid 1940’s.  Initial collection growth coincided with the large-scale trips organized by Blair between 1949-1955 to west Texas and the Panhandle, as well as many local and regional (particularly east Texas) collecting trips by Blair and his students; Blair was hired in 1946, became Professor in 1955 and Emeritus Professor in 1982, passing away on 09 February 1984.  Large and consistent growth to the collections continued through the mid 1970’s through the work of by Blair and his large number of students.  Blair’s contributions to science include five books (three with sole authorship), 148 papers (119 had sole authorship), supervised 100 Dissertations and Theses.   Collection growth waned for a decade but again increased following the hiring of a curator of herpetology, David Cannatella, in 1990. \n\nIn 2000, the TNHC received 18,000 specimens from the TTU herpetology collection, representing the largest collection of herpetological specimens from the Texas Panhandle.  Although this was the single largest separate herpetology collection accessioned by the TNHC, other smaller collections have been acquired, including a collection of 199 specimens from Dr. Norman Richard of Brownsville TX and 890 specimens donated by Dr. Thomas Scanlon, formerly at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  \n\nThe collection contains 496 type specimens (18 primary and 478 secondary) of 37 taxa.  All types are stored in 70% non-denatured ethanol, save two prepared as dry skeletons and seven prepared as cleared and stained specimens.\n\nCurators Cannatella and LaDuc and UT graduate students continue to add important material to the collections, most recently from the U.S., Southeast Asia, and Central and South America.",

Specimens from Colorado and the surrounding plains, plateaus, and basins are the strength of our collection. The UCM Egg & Nest Collection contains over 2,250 egg sets and nests. Nearly three-quarters of this collection was assembled by distinguished naturalists Denis Gale and G. Morrison in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. These historic specimens represent much of the avifauna found in Colorado and several Midwestern states, and are accompanied by detailed field notes. An additional 600 egg sets collected in the US and Peru in the late 1970s-1990s are preserved as broken fragments, historically used to examine variation in eggshell gas exchange in montane and lowland habitats.",

BHSC features the worldâs largest collection of the distinctive vascular flora of the ecologically unique Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. The collection contains vascular plants, algae, bryophytes and lichens. In addition, the collection consists of approximately 4000 specimens of fungi and slime molds, which include nearly all of the South Dakota state records. The extant vascular plant collection includes a limited number of specimens from around the world; including collections by A. Eastwood, P.O. Schallert, L.S. Rose, J.A. Calder, B.C. Tharp, W.H. Duncan, A.E. Radford, J.M. Gillet, C.G. Pringle, O. Degner, P.A. Munz, E.J. Palmer, K. Biswas, and B. Rosengurtt. Other important collections include those of F.L. Bennett (former BHSC Curator) and M.L. Kravig (Orchidologist). BHSC is also home to one of the largest collections of Miocene age plant fossils from the Great Plains of North America, with at least 10,000 fossils housed from throughout the Great Plains. Type collections of several fossil species from J.R. Thomasson and M.L. Gabel are held in the collection. Grasses (Poaceae), hackberries (Celtis, Ulmaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae) and borages (Boraginaceae) are well represented.",

It is a part of the Department of Zoology and Physiology. The collection was started in 1894 and Wilbur C. Knight, the state geologist, was appointed as the first curator. The museum's mission was to document and describe Wyoming's avian biodiversity. There was a brief period of active collecting by Knight and Charles W. Gilmore in 1897 and 1898. This was followed by a period of inactivity until the arrival of Ernest Pilsbury Walker as an undergraduate. He collected specimens around the southeastern part of the state from 1910 through 1912. He also contributed his personal collection from Sheridan, Indiana. Beyond sporadic trading and salvaging, the collection has been mostly inactive for the past 100 years until Matt Carling was hired as curator and James Maley was hired as collections manager. The collection was moved into the Berry Center and organized, and it is now undergoing rapid expansion.",

The major strengths of the collection, amphibians from the southeastern United States and both reptiles and amphibians from the Northeast, reflects the intensive collection by the Wrights. Much of the material collected by the Wrights in New York and Georgia is not duplicated elsewhere. The last 15 years have been seen important acquisitions for the collection. To complement our traditional strength in North American taxa, we have made a concerted effort to obtain foreign material, especially synoptic series representing geographic areas. Through collecting, exchanges and acquisition of other various collections we now have good representation of Costa Rican viperids, lizards from Western and South Australia, amphibians and reptiles from Puerto Rico, snakes and lizards from Mexico, and a more representative collection of African and European species.",

In addition, the vertebrate zoology department houses regional and comparative foreign specimens of all vertebrate classes including: eggs, nests, skins, osteological preparations, pickled preparations, tissue collections and associated field notes and catalogues.  The historic collections contain material from as early as 1849 and have continued to grow in size and scope to now house over 40,000 specimens of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and eggs, and mammals.",

It contains a good representation of the flora of the midwestern United States, but most of its specimens were collected in Illinois. Students and faculty conducting ecological studies and floristic inventories use the herbarium to help identify the plants they see and collect. Students in Plant Taxonomy, Dendrology, and Wetland Plants classes use it to become familiar with species and for identification of specimens. In the Wetland Plants, General Botany, Ethnobotany, and Plant Morphology classes, herbarium specimens are used to to make morphological comparisons among relevant plant taxa. The herbarium was started in 1899. Originally named the Stover Herbarium for Dr. Ernest L. Stover, professor of botany from 1923-1960, the Botany Dept. faculty voted in 1995 to &quot;expand&quot; the name to honor John E. Ebinger on the occasion of his retirement. Dr. Ebinger collected about half the specimens in the collection and served as curator from 1963-1995. For information about vascular plants and bryophytes, contact Dr. Gordon C. Tucker (gctucker@eiu.edu); for fungi and lichens, contact Dr. Andrew S. Methven (asmethven@eiu.edu).",

Macrofungal collections were first accessioned in 1980 by Dr. Timothy J. Baroni and his students and continue to be the bulk of the newly added collections to the herbarium. Macrofungi (Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes) of Upstate New York, and especially the Adirondack Park, are well represented, with collections also from the Southeastern United States, the Gulf Coastal States and California. Collections from Europe (mainly from the Alps), the Greater and Lesser Antilles (Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, St. John USVI, Trinidad), Central America (Belize and Costa Rica), South America (Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela), Mexico and to a lesser extent Thailand and Tasmania are also important components of the research materials curated at Cortland.",

There are an estimated 3,000 type specimens. The collection is particularly rich in ferns, bryophytes and grasses, as well as in historically important materials from early botanical collectors. In addition, it was the herbarium of record for the flora of southern New England from 1864 until 1955, when that function passed to the University of Connecticut at Storrs.",

In 1988, at President AltmanÂs direction, the University expanded the Arboretum to include a 5-acre (2.0 ha) Cypress dome, an oak hammock of about 3 acres (1.2 ha), and about 15 acres (6.1 ha) of sand pine and Florida scrub, connected to the original Arboretum by a saw palmetto (Sabal palmetto) community and increasingly rare Florida longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) flatwoods. Currently, the official Arboretum Boundary encompasses approximately 82 acres (33.2 ha). The original Arboretum director was Dr. Henry O. Whittier, a professor in the Biology Department who remained director until his retirement 2003. Dr. Martin Quigley was director from 2003-2009.",

Dr. Arthur A. Allen, on the faculty at Cornell from 1915–1953, made the name Cornell nearly synonymous with ornithology in the United States. Allen contributed many birds to the collection, and possibly even more importantly, attracted a very large number of students interested in birds. His numerous students contributed specimens from their research and travels all over the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other parts of the world. The CU collection contain many specimens collected by of Cornell faculty such as George M. Sutton, Charles Sibley, William Dilger, and Tom Cade, but also contains student specimens of Dean Amadon, Walter Bock, F. Graham Cooch, John Emlen, Herbert Friedmann, Ludlow Griscom, Harry Hann, Robert Mengel, Eugene Morton, Ralph Palmer, Kenneth Parkes, Olin S. Pettingill, Alan Phillips, Austin Rand, James Rising, Lester Short, Stanley Temple, Harrison Tordoff, David Wingate, as well as many others. The CUMV Bird Collection currently consists of approximately 38,300 round skins, 700 flat skins, 1,000 spread wings, 5,500 skeletons, 1,400 fluid-preserved specimens, 3,200 egg sets, 590 nests, and 1,000 uncataloged mounts. Approximately 350 of the skeletons have an associated flatskin, and approximately 150 round skins have a separate spread wing.",

The major goal of the museum is to make the collection more relevant to ecologists, especially those working on projects related to issues of conservation and biodiversity. We provide entomological consultation regarding identification and biology of insect and spider pests as well as 'bugs' that people are just curious in knowing about.",

            "collection_description": "The Illinois Natural History Survey Crustacean Collection is one of the largest state collections of crustaceans in North America. A few specimens now housed in the collection were collected in the late 1800's by Stephen A. Forbes. They formed the basis for the first article to appear in the Survey's Bulletin \"List of Illinois Crustacea.\" More specimens were collected during the first half of the 1900's in conjunction with the insect surveys organized by Herbert H. Ross. A large part of the collection comes from specimens collected from 1972 to 1982 for Lawrence M. Page's \"The Crayfishes and Shrimps (Decapoda) of Illinois\" published in 1985. Since that time, significant collections have been made documenting the spread of invasive crayfishes in Illinios and surveying the states of Kentucky and Alambama. We've also recently acquired a statewide collection of Missouri crayfishes. Holdings - The collection contains primary types of nine species and secondary types of 5 species. The collection contains over 91,000 specimens and 12,100 lots of approximately 350 species in 30 families. Almost all are from North America. About 50% of the collection is from Illinois; the remainder is mostly from the southeastern United States. The best represented groups are crayfishes, shrimps, scuds, slaters, and pill bugs.  A few lots of marine crustaceans found along the North American coastline are also present in the collection. We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998.",

In fulfillment of this objective, the department collects, archives and studies specimens of recent mammals and the data associated with those specimens. We aim always to provide the highest standards of curatorial care and to promote access to the collections by other scholars. The collections are visited by an average of 130 researchers every year, and the Department loans over 500 specimens a year to researchers around the globe.\nThe Recent Mammals Collection, together with the remarkable collection of books, journals, and manuscripts of the Department Library and Archives provides scholars with outstanding resources for research in mammalian systematics, biodiversity and evolutionary biology.",

The paleontology collection houses both vertebrate and invertebrate specimens, ranging from Cambrian archaeocyathids to Quaternary mammals. Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.",

The dried skin and skeletal preparations are stored in 732 metal cabinets. These cabinets are specially designed to keep the specimens safe from UV light, dust, occasional insect pests, and other harmful agents. Every specimen is labeled with information concerning its species, sex, collector, preparator, collecting location, and other pieces of collecting data. Each specimen has also been given a catalog number and its data verified and entered into a searchable computer database. All specimens of the same species are stored together, organized by country, state, county, and finally catalog number. Groups of related species are housed in adjacent cases. As with the Genetic Resources Collection, the majority of these specimens in this collection are bar coded and a project is underway to bar code the rest to facilitate the retrieval of associated data and to reduce time and effort spent by the NSRL staff in maintaining an organized collection.",

            "collection_description": "History: The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  See \"A History of Herpetology in Illinois\" for more information on early herpetologists in Illinois.\n\nHoldings: The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study \"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,\" published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).\n\nFrozen Tissues: We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above. The search engine will deliver limited location information.",

With the exception of birds, our collections are the largest collections of their kind in Colorado. Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The Mammal collection includes over 16,000 specimens with representation from twenty-five countries, with the majority of specimens from Colorado (nearly 70%) and other western states. Specimens are typically preserved as a set of a study skin and an extracted skull, although large mammals are also prepared as hides, taxidermy, and skeletons. Many people have added to the mammal collection over the years, including the pioneer Colorado naturalist, Edward Royal Warren (3,000+ specimens), Donald A. Spencer, Dallas A. Sutton, Leslie Viereck, and emeritus professor and former Museum Director, David M. Armstrong. E.R. Warren's archive of field notes and photographs are an invaluable resource for documenting distributions and changes of Colorado mammals in the first three decades of the 20th century.",

            "collection_description": "The mammal collection at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum is one of the world's largest (the fifth largest mammal collection in North America and the third largest university collection in the world).  The most common preparation type is a prepared skin, with the skull cleaned and stored in a separated container (our preparation code is SS).  Second-most common is a skin with the entire skeleton cleaned and stored separately (SB).  Some specimens consist only of a skull (SK) or cranium (CO).  Other specimens may consist of a partial skeleton (PS), an entire skeleton (SN) or only a skin (SO).  Many of our specimens are stored in alcohol (AL), or are in alcohol with the skull removed and cleaned (SA).  Tissues associated with any of these preparation types are noted as a separate field in our database.  Because there are active public education and exhibits programs in the KU Natural History Museum, a few of our specimens are taxidermy mounts (BM) and some are housed permanently on exhibit.  Other preparation types are coded as “other” (OT).  Occasionally, specimens are prepared with the baculum or os clitoris and separately stored in preserving fluid.  Non-standard preparation types and additional materials are noted in a comments field in our database.<br><br>\n\n\nWe have extensive historical collections from Central America, Mexico, and southeast, central, western regions of the United States and Alaska.  We recently added outstanding collections from the Philippines and New Guinea.  We anticipate continuing to maintain our strengths in these geographic regions, emphasizing bats, rodents and insectivores—current taxonomic strengths.  Most of our collection consists of nicely prepared skins, skulls, and complete skeletons, with most recent specimens accompanied by tissues.<br><br>\n\nThere are 135 type specimens in our collection at present.  Of these, the largest number (97) are rodents.  There are also 6 insectivore, 25 bat, 5 lagomorph, and 2 carnivore holotypes.  Lists of the Mammalogy's type specimens have been published by Jones and Genoways (1969) and Jones et al. (1984), although several have been described since.  Types have been described from Barbados, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (14 states), Mozambique, Nicaragua, Philippines, Venezuela, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and from 12 states in the U.S.  All type specimens are kept in the designated \"type case\" at all times.  Use of type specimens must be arranged with the curators.<br> <br>\n\nThere is broad taxonomic coverage, including important holdings of Central and South American marsupials, insectivores, bats, rodents; Holarctic shrews, microtines, squirrels and North American bats, insectivores, carnivores, rodents and lagomorphs.",

The collection contains 16 holotypes, 6 paratypes, 1 syntype, 93 symbiotypes. Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (26,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), and the Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites). Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to \"holistic vouchers\" containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites. Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 130,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970's. Serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas are associated with 37,000 specimens. The MSB houses an extensive archive of field journals and catalogues that date to the 1900's and are associated with specimens held in the collection. The collections are growing rapidly through the active research programs of curators, staff, and students, and through ongoing collaborations with other institutions and governmental agencies.",

The collection has particularly strong geographic representation of the Pacific Northwest. More than 2,200 specimens are forest-dwelling amphibians from Western Washington obtained during wildlife studies in the 1980s and early 1990s. About 900 are garter snakes collected during the mid-1900s. In 2010, Dr. Adam Leache joined the Burke Museum as Curator of Genetic Resources and Herpetology. The entire collection was inventoried, catalogued, and georeferenced. This transition made the Burke Herpetology data searchable and mappable to the public for the first time. The geographic scope of the collection has expended greatly since 2010, and new collections from Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Ghana are now available that reflect active research programs by herpetology staff. The collection consists largely of alcohol-reserved specimens with a small number of photographs and skeletons. Genetic resources are available for all specimens collected since 2010.",

            "collection_description": "The Herbarium (ALA) at the University of Alaska Museum is the major regional herbarium in Alaska and part of a network of similar collections with an interest in the origin and evolution of the circumpolar flora. ALA contains more than 235,000 specimens of vascular and non-vascular plants. Data for the Vascular Plant and Cryptogam collections are managed separately in Arctos. Most lichen collections in the ALA date from the early post WWII period, after the Alcan (now Alaska Highway) was completed, including specimens from John Thomson’s first of two Alaska expeditions in 1958 on the Arctic Slope as well as his 1967 expedition along the Alaska Highway. The contributions of three other people, H. Persson and W. C. Steere (bryophytes) and H. Krog (lichens), further strengthened the foundation for ALA’s cryptogamic collections. Barbara Murray’s collecting started in the 1970s just after the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay on the arctic coast of Alaska. Use of helicopters became frequent and as a result Murray has collected large number of specimens at over 250 Alaskan localities. The ALA cryptogamic collection has recently been supported by two NSF grants (NSF- 1023407: Toward Documenting Biodiversity Change in Arctic Lichens: Databasing the Principal Collections, Establishing a Baseline, and Developing a Virtual Flora (with University of Wisconsin) and NSF NSF-1115056: TCN Collaborative Research: North American Lichens and Bryophytes: Sensitive Indicators of Environmental Quality and Change) to help with digitization of specimen data and taking care of large backlogs of specimens. The majority of the cryptogam collections are from Alaska, while numerous collections are also from Russia, Fennoscandia, Canada and the lower 48 United States.",

            "collection_description": "The CUMV Fish Collection was established shortly after the founding of the university in 1865. Many of our earliest specimens were collected by well-known researchers such as David Starr Jordan, Carl Eigenmann, Charles Frederick Hartt and Seth Meek. By 1935, the collection contained only 3,000 lots, but during the following 35 years, Edward Raney and his students built the finest collection of eastern North American freshwater fishes in existence today. In Collette and Lachner's (1976) report on fish collections in the United States and Canada, the CUMV Fish Collection ranked thirteenth among all collections and fourth among National Resource Centers in North America. Although there is worldwide representation of both marine and freshwater species, the bulk of the collection is strongly representative of freshwater fishes from eastern North America and has formed the basis for numerous systematic works on the North American fish fauna. Much of the material is in large geographic series, and many sites have been sampled repeatedly through extended periods of time. Some specimens are from the original New York State Biological Survey (1926–1939). Many of our collections are from the highly industrialized Northeast and Middle Atlantic states and thus document earlier faunas in habitats now greatly altered, and we have repeated samples through time from many of these localities. The primary activities for the last several years has been collection building efforts directed toward African freshwater fishes.",

The major strengths of the collection, amphibians from the southeastern United States and both reptiles and amphibians from the Northeast, reflects the intensive collection by the Wrights. Much of the material collected by the Wrights in New York and Georgia is not duplicated elsewhere. The last 15 years have been seen important acquisitions for the collection. To complement our traditional strength in North American taxa, we have made a concerted effort to obtain foreign material, especially synoptic series representing geographic areas. Through collecting, exchanges and acquisition of other various collections we now have good representation of Costa Rican viperids, lizards from Western and South Australia, amphibians and reptiles from Puerto Rico, snakes and lizards from Mexico, and a more representative collection of African and European species.",

ALA contains more than 235,000 specimens of vascular and non-vascular plants. Data for the Vascular Plant and Cryptogam collections are managed separately in Arctos. Much of our understanding of Ice Age Beringia is based on botanical specimens, the largest collection of which is housed at ALA. Our recent acquisition from Iowa State University of the J. P. Anderson Collection (32,000 specimens on permanent loan) forms a significant part of this story. This collection of arctic and boreal plants, which contains 67 nomenclatural type specimens, formed the basis for much of Andersonâ€™s seminal work, The Flora of Alaska. The botanical collection also includes plants from other states, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia, Japan, and Russia and provides a basis for teaching and research. Our botanical collection can be viewed and searched through the Arctos database and includes high resolution images of 163,000 herbarium sheets, online representation of 190,000 holdings, and inclusion of all holdings in an object-tracking system (barcode labeling).",

            "collection_description": "Florida State University's Robert K. Godfrey Herbarium is a museum-quality collection of over 220,000 plant and microalgae specimens. These document the distribution and natural variation of the 2,400 species of flowering plants, ferns, conifers, and cycads found in northern Florida-one of North America's biodiversity hotspots-and the microalgae of Florida’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Each plant specimen is carefully identified, pressed, dried, and mounted to archival standards, with accompanying data on where and when it was collected. The specimens are a valued resource to local, state, national, and international biologists studying plant and microalgae systematics, ecology, evolution, biogeography, conservation biology, anatomy, and morphology. New specimens are added to the collection each week. As of May 2014, the collection includes all specimens from Stetson University's Herbarium (DLF). In August 2003, Austin Mast became the new director of the herbarium. Though now retired, Loran Anderson remains active in the herbarium. The current curator is Chris Buddenhagen.\n\nIn August of 2003 the Robert K. Godfrey Herbarium set up a digital imaging system and SQL database. Currently 79,705 of our 220,000+ specimens have been entered into the herbarium's database. In late 2010, Tall Timbers Research Station's Herbarium began serving specimen data and images on this site as well. Currently, data and images for 10,344 of Tall Timbers Research Station's 10,000+ herbarium specimens are being served. Specimen images and data from both institution's can be searched by following the database links on our menu or by clicking here.",

The collection is worldwide in scope, with approximately 75% of the collection from North America and the other 25% from the Arctic, Australia, Central American, Europe, Israel, Pakistan, Lebanon, South America and the West Indies. Tracing its roots back to the early 19th century, this collection is one of the most historically significant in the United States. Included among its riches are plant fossils from the opening of the American West, from the Wilkes Expedition of 1838–1842 described by James Dwight Dana, Triassic and late Cretaceous floras from New York, New Jersey and southern New England; and the world’s largest assemblage of cycadeoids.",

It will treat the North American biota utilizing collections within the USA. Not only is the size of the problem tractable, but also nearly all of the collections relevant to the United States biota reside within the United States, with substantial amounts of material from Canada and Mexico also being available in US institutions. The TTD will be coordinated by seven collaborating institutions. Each possesses necessary taxonomic expertise, proven leadership skills, and the ability to form networks with another 27 large and small institutions, to capture and deliver specimen data for organisms in all three trophic levels.",

The size of this collection ranks it as one of the largest such collections in North America. Eggs of nest parasites (e.g., cowbirds) are present in approximately 120 sets, and 150 egg sets or nests are associated with catalogued bird specimens. Eggs in this collection range in size from the tiny eggs of hummingbirds (0.2 grams) to the gigantic eggs of the extinct elephant bird (9 kilograms). Approximately 80-90% of the specimens are accompanied by original collector data slips and by photographs of sets taken in the museum, both of which are digitally linked to the record online. These data slips contain information on collecting locality, date, clutch size, incubation, identification, nest composition, and nest placement.",

            "collection_description": "The San Diego Natural History Museum Department of Herpetology focuses on the study of amphibians and reptiles. Resources are available to scientists to help better understand amphibian and reptile biology and conserve species when their existence is threatened. The great diversity of amphibian and reptile species is preserved for scientific research in the form of alcohol-preserved and skeletal specimens. The herpetology collection holds over 76,000 catalogued specimens (73,300 fluid-preserved specimens and 3,100 skeletons with 212 primary and 500 secondary types) dating back to the 1890s. The collection has been built over the past century and is actively being added to today. All cataloged specimens are computer databased which allows for any combination of taxonomic and geographic records to be searched.",
