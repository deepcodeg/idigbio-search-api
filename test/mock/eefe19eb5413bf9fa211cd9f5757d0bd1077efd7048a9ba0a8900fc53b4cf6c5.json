These counts are underestimated because they were made over a decade ago and the majority of the collection holdings have not been identified nor cataloged. The estimated minimal numbers are: Pinned Insects about 1 million individuals, Med/Vet Zoology about 75,000, Arachnids under 50,000, Miscellaneous groups under 1,000. At least 3 million specimens are retained as sealed, bulk specimens. These samples are mostly cataloged and are being split and labeled as time permits (motivated by researchersÂ needs).
