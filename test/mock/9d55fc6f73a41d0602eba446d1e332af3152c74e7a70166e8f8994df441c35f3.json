The collection is 90% freshwater species (mussels, fingernail clams, and snails) and 10% terrestrial species (snails). Most of the specimens were collected as a result of various faunal surveys conducted by INHS biologists from the late 1800's until the present. The early collections were made by such naturalists as John W. Powell, Robert Kennicott, Richard E. Call, William A. Nason, Frank C. Baker, Robert E. Richardson, and Charles A. Hart. The snails are divided between terrestrial (13%) and freshwater (5%) species, most of which were collected more than 50 years ago. The largest and best documented collection of snails at the Survey was compiled by Thural D. Foster and organized by Frank C. Baker as part of his study on the \"Landsnails of Illinois\" published in 1939. The Baker snail collection numbers 1632 lots containing 11,970 specimens.",

These counts are underestimated because they were made over a decade ago and the majority of the collection holdings have not been identified nor cataloged. The estimated minimal numbers are: Pinned Insects about 1 million individuals, Med/Vet Zoology about 75,000, Arachnids under 50,000, Miscellaneous groups under 1,000. At least 3 million specimens are retained as sealed, bulk specimens. These samples are mostly cataloged and are being split and labeled as time permits (motivated by researchers needs). There are currently slightly more than 800 type specimens (mostly paratypes) in the collection.",

Today, the herbarium houses around 125,000 specimens of vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, fungi, and algae, making it the third largest herbarium in Ohio. In addition to the large collection of regional and North American material, it also contains extensive collections from Europe, South America, the Caribbean Basin, Samoa, and China. Particular strengths of the herbarium are North American Sphagnum, South American and Caribbean Hepatics, North American Cladonia, and Trilliaceae.",

Robert T. Moore and his wife Margaret founded the MLZ in 1950, moving Moore’s personal collection from his Pasadena home to the building at Occidental College. Prominent collectors aside from Moore include Chester C. Lamb (who worked as Moore’s primary collector for decades and collected over 40,000 of the MLZ’s specimens), the Olalla Brothers and Sons, Mario del Toro Aviles, C.F. Underwood, J.T. Wright, and W.W. Brown. The collection continues its growth today with the addition of species from the western U.S. and Mexico.",

Atualmente conta com mais de 18.300 espécimes acondicionados e organizados em 3890 lotes, incluindo 66 tipos (12 holótipos e 54 parátipos). A coleção representa uma referência essencial para estudos de biodiversidade marinha em nível regional e nacional, com material coletado ao longo de toda a costa brasileira, além de material proveniente do Caribe (Panamá), Oceano Austral (Antártica), Mar Adriático (Croácia) e Mar da Noruega (Noruega). No que concerne à costa brasileira, apresenta uma boa cobertura da região da Bacia de Campos, incluindo regiões de mar profundo, referentes a material coletado em programas de pesquisa desta região como o Programa REVIZEE (MMA) e os Programas OCEANPROF e HABITATS, ambos coordenados pela Petrobrás. A coleção também começou a receber material das Ilhas Oceânicas Brasileiras, principalmente do Atol das Rocas e do Arquipélago de São Pedro e São Paulo. O material depositado está sendo preparado, conferido e em breve será incorporado à coleção de Polychaeta do Museu Nacional (MN) do Rio de Janeiro da UFRJ. Sendo o primeiro museu de história natural do Brasil e um dos principais museus brasileiros atuais, o Museu Nacional exibe vocação natural para centralização da principal coleção de poliquetas da UFRJ e para o desenvolvimento de uma coleção de referência nacional para um dos grupos mais diversos de invertebrados marinhos.",

The collection has grown about 6-fold since 1989, and it continues to grow rapidly through salvage and research-driven collecting. Approximately 40% of the specimens have frozen tissues associated with them. Collection highlights include: Synoptic series of the Birds of New Mexico for ID reference and teaching; the personal collection of Dale Zimmerman, donated in 2004, which contributed significantly to the taxonomic and geographic scope of the collection; the collection of Amadeo Rea, upon which the book Once a River was based; raptors and game birds of J.M. Campbell; the J. Stokley Ligon collections (in part); and representative threatened, endangered and extinct species of North America. All but the most recent research specimens are published online via the database Arctos.",

The Herpetology collection spans 77 countries, with its geographic strength in Mexican and the southwestern United States species. It contains over 68,000 specimens, including over 22,000 from Mexico, which have been actively studied and cited in systematic herpetology publications over recent decades. Additionally, the whiptail lizards (genus <i>Aspidoscelis</i>) are particularly well represented, including over 12,000 fluid-preserved specimens and two hundred dry skulls. The world-renowned herpetologists, Hobart M. Smith and T. Paul Maslin, as well as a number of their students and collaborators, were the major architects of our largest vertebrate collection. R. Earl Olson's contribution of 3,800+ specimens recently expanded our taxonomic and geographic coverage, including new material from Minnesota and Haiti. Most recently, Julio A. Lemos-Espinal contributed 2,600 specimens from the northern Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua, and Coahuila.",

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.\n\nThe museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.",

Field collections of habitats thought to contain tardigrades were made throughout the Long Term Ecological Research Sites  (LTER’s) in the United States from 2007 – 2012.  Other areas, both nationally and internationally were opportunistically sampled.  Samples were processed at Fresno City College with identifications being done by FCC undergraduate students, supervised by Dr. Randy Miller, and Carl Johansson, with DNA being done at BYU on selected samples. Over 15,000 tardigrades were collected and processed during that time.

It currently holds over 100,000 specimens with a worldwide distribution, representing all vertebrate classes from the \nSilurian to the Pleistocene. This collection was acquired primarily through over a century of field work by section staff and associates as well as acquisitions by the Museum. Fossil collecting began in 1895 with the sponsorship of \nMr. Andrew Carnegie, who supported the museum’s numerous early expeditions to the American West that resulted in one of the best dinosaur collections in the world. Carnegie in his retirement further strengthened the collection with \nthe purchase in 1903 of a large collection of Paleozoic-Cenozoic, European fossils from the Baron de Bayet, a private fossil collector from Brussels, Belgium. Strengths of the collection include Mississippian fishes from Bear Gulch, \nMontana; Pennsylvanian and Permian fishes, amphibians and reptiles from the tri-state region of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia and the southwestern United States; Jurassic dinosaurs, especially sauropods, from Utah (Dinosaur \nNational Monument) and Wyoming; Jurassic fishes and reptiles from Germany and France; Eocene fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy; Eocene mammals, reptiles, and amphibians from central Wyoming and Utah; Miocene mammals from a site now \npreserved as Agate Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska; and Pleistocene vertebrates from the Appalachian region.",

            "collection_description": "History: The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  See \"A History of Herpetology in Illinois\" for more information on early herpetologists in Illinois. Holdings: The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study \"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,\" published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963). Frozen Tissues: We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above. The search engine will deliver limited location information.",

Essentially, these are pinned (dried) imagos but the collections also hold caterpillars (“blown” larvae or material preserved in alcohol), as well as a set of over 95.000 “genitalia” preparations. Amongst these collections, one can mention some particularly important ones: Mrs Fournier de Horrack, composed of precious exotical Rhopalocera, the type collection (ca. 11.000 Heterocera type specimens + numerous Rhopalocera), the rich Malagasy Heterocera collection (P. Viette’s achievement, essentially), and the Erebidae-Arctiinae collection (which includes ca. 30.000 neotropical specimens, most of them offered by H. de Toulgoët), the Psychidae collection (re-organized by J. Bourgogne), the Saturniidae collection (C. Lemaire and P.-C. Rougeot) and the Sesiidae collection (F. Le Cerf, notably). The Malagasy Heterocera and Saturniidae collections are the most important of their kinds worldwide (both qualitatively and quantitatively).

The largest parts of the collection are, in descending order, from Nebraska, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, other parts of North America, and Europe. It contains important collections by such scientifically notable Nebraskans as Charles Bessey, Ernst Bessey, Frederic Clements, Walter Kiener, Per Rydberg, Raymond Pool, Jared G. Smith; by other Nebraskans who later became prominent in other fields, such as Roscoe Pound (Law), Louise Pound (Literature), Willa Cather (Literature), Melvin Gilmore (Ethnobotany), Lawrence Bruner (Entomology) and Henry Baldwin Ward (Parasitology); and by many prominent scientists from outside the state.",

Additional collections include bryophytes and lichens. The Archbold Biological Station is also known as the Leonard J. Brass Herbarium, named in honor of worldwide plant collector, palm expert, explorer, conservationist, and botanist, L.J. Brass (1900-1971). Dr. Brass founded this herbarium and collected the majority of its specimens. In February 2010, we also dedicated this collection to Dorothy Mundell, in appreciation of her long-time service to the herbarium. Carl Weekley and Rebecca Yahr also made significant contributions to the ABS herbarium. Eric Menges is currently the curator.",

Rock Herbarium (HAW) serves the official university repository for plant specimens associated with student, staff, and faculty teaching and research. The herbaria was created by Dr. Joseph F. Rock's original collections and is the oldest herbaria in Hawaii. It is the result of decades of plant exploration by some of the leading researchers in the Pacific basin and today its use continues to expand. The herbarium is part of the University Museum Consortium, and comprises approximately 60,000 dried preserved plant specimens including algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, angiosperms, fungi, and ancillary collections of 35 mm slides, wood, seed, and DNA. For more than 100 years, the herbarium has been a focal point for teaching, training, and education on the flora of Hawai'i and the Pacific with particular emphasis on vascular plants. Since 2009, the herbarium has also managed the departments living collection in the St. John Courtyard.",

Physiographically, most collections are from montane regions, less than 10% from the Piedmont, and the Coastal Plain is essentially unrepresented. Most specimens are of the foliose or fruticose type, with only a few crustose or sub-crustose. The lichen collection is growing slowing with new accessions coming from diverse areas and habitats.",

With the exception of birds, our collections are the largest collections of their kind in Colorado. Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The collection of fishes is primarily preserved in fluid, with some osteological and dried specimens. It contains over 24,000 specimens in roughly 1,900 lots. The majority were collected in Colorado, although there is a worldwide representation of both marine and freshwater species. Many specimens were collected in the early 1900s by Max M. Ellis, including several hundred from Guyana. The collection also includes about 2000 Salmonid specimens donated by Robert J. Behnke, Colorado State University Professor Emeritus and the author of Trout and Salmon of North America. Nearly 10% of our holdings are representatives of endangered and threatened species.",

We have a small selection of larval fish from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands maintained in 10% formalin. Our skeletal collection contains 794 cleared and stained fish, as well as 410 dry skeletal preps. Many of the skeletal specimens originate from W. W. Dalquest and his students. We also have a tissue collection currently with over 515 samples preserved in 100% ethanol frozen in liquid nitrogen. Our type collection includes 3 holotypes, 110 paratypes, and 1 allotype. Our holdings were collected between 1927 and present and there was a significant increase in collections during 1950–1980, mainly by Clark Hubbs and his students. In 1993 we acquired the collections of the University of Texas at Austin’s Marine Science Institute, totaling ~ 3,000 lots of ethanol preserved specimens from the Gulf of Mexico. Between 2000 and 2011 we acquired collections of ethanol preserved specimens from Midwestern University, Texas Tech University, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, The University of Texas at Brownsville and Lamar University. We are working on cataloging these specimens, and will make those data available as soon as possible. Our collection is rapidly growing and many of our incoming specimens come from Dean Hendrickson and his students, museum staff, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and various researchers.",

The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.</br></br>\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette & Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region's fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.</br></br>\n\nThe tissue collection comprises tissue samples originally collected in liquid nitrogen, DMSO and ethanol and stored in state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen dewars at -170°C. The tissues are made up mostly of muscle tissue but also includes, liver and other internal organs, fin clips and whole specimens.  A large proportion of our collection has vouchers held either at KU or at other collections.  The provenance of these vouchers is indicated in the database</br></br>",

The growth and wide-ranging scope of this collection can be credited to the diverse interests of the systematists who have spent all or part of their career at the Survey. Scientists such as Stephen A. Forbes, the first Director of the State Laboratory and Chief of the Natural History Survey; Theodore Frison, who succeeded Forbes; and H. H. Ross, who directed the intense systematics studies of the faunistic section for 40 years, placed considerable emphasis on enlarging the insect collection. These insects document the changing landscape and environmental conditions of the world.\n\nThe INHS insect collection is one of the largest in North America. The most recent size estimate was done in 1992. The heavy concentration of specimens from the last third of the 1800s also makes this one of North America's oldest insect and related arthropod collections. \n\nThe INHS Insect Collection includes more than 13,000 primary types (syntypes inclusive). Because of size, historical holdings, and wide breadth of coverage in certain groups, the collection is an important national and worldwide resource.",

The herbarium combines significant palaeobotanical, bryological, lichenological, mycological, phycological and vascular plants totaling over 160,000 specimens, all housed in a fully modern, state-of-the-art facility. We are in the process of databasing our phycology collections. Over 2000 specimens have been entered to date. All specimens will eventually be imaged and made available on this site. Sample images are available for the genus Porphyra. The specimens were discovered in various parts of the Torrey Life Sciences Building during the move to the new combined collections facility. The majority of the collection dates from the latter part of the nineteenth century, starting around the mid 1870’s and is mostly from New England. Specimens range from those collected by eminent phycologists such as Frank Shipley Collins and Isaac Holden to other UConn collectors such as Andrew E. Wheeler, Joanna Page, George Safford Torrey and Frank Trainor. New collections are being added by students from the Biology of Algae course. A small minority of specimens are from Australia, Bahamas, California, Florida and Puerto Rico. Also included are exsiccatae separates from Algae Boreali-Americanae and the Phycotheca Boreali-Americana. Collins, Holden, and Setchell. With an active phycology faculty CONN is interested in exchanging duplicates to add to our collections. Comments on the data and requests to loan the specimens or receive archived high resolution images are welcome.",

Pammel and his students, including George W. Carver, continued to build the mycological collection. Pammel himself added approximately 7,500 specimens. In 1916, Irving E. Melhus was hired as Iowa State&amp;apos;s first plant pathologist. Two years later, Joseph C. Gilman joined Melhus as a mycologist and plant pathologist.\r\nSubsequent studies of plant diseases, continued through the work of\r\nLois H. Tiffany, who added numerous specimens from Iowa State parks\r\nand preserves. Dr. Tiffany is also responsible for the placement here\r\nof the prestigious University of Iowa Mycological Herbarium when it\r\nwas decided that the collection could no longer be housed at Iowa\r\nCity. This collection contains the specimens of George Martin, Thomas\r\nH. Macbride, and A. P.

The egg collection of the WFVZ is the largest in the world.</br></br>\n\nThe Western Foundation’s collections have contributed to multiple scientific fields (e.g., conservation, ecology, taxonomy, and toxicology). For example, the WFVZ provided photocopies of egg records for more than 500 species, and egg measurements for more than 400 species, covered by the Birds of North America series. This information and digital pictures of these eggs and nests are now available at www.birds.cornell.edu/birdsofna.  The Foundation’s egg sets have also figured prominently in studies of eggshell thinning due to contaminants (e.g., DDT and heavy metals). Since 2000 alone, the WFVZ has contributed data to more than 200 publications. Thus, the value of the WFVZ’s collections for science, and for the conservation of bird species, continues to be evidenced.</br></br>\n\nStaff of the WFVZ provide data on eggs, including measurements and digital images, to researchers. Please contact René Corado, Collections Manager, for more information, and see our list of services available to researchers.</br></br>\n\nNests:</br> \nThe Foundation has more than 18,000 specimens from around the world, representing the largest collection of nests in North America and the world.</br></br>\n\nWFVZ pictures of the nests of North American breeding bird species are available at www.birds.cornell.edu/birdsofna, or researchers can contact us for particular digital images.</br></br>\n\nSkins:</br>\nThe WFVZ houses more than 56,000 study skin specimens representing over 100 countries, with the largest numbers of specimens from the United States (>12,900), Mexico (>12,600), Malaysia (>4,400), Costa Rica (>4,000), and Ecuador (>3,800). The skin collection is at least the 16th largest among North American collections.</br></br>\n\nThe primary sources for specimens currently are wildlife rehabilitation organizations; wildlife research agencies; birds killed by cats, window strikes, and car impacts; and the Foundation’s own field research projects.  Materials are consistently acquired by the Western Foundation and used by researchers, educators, scientific artists, and other museums.  In addition, materials are used in educational tours and presentations for the general public, both at the Foundation and at outside events.</br></br>\n\nSkin loans are made to qualified researchers.",

The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.  Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.</br></br>",

            "collection_description": "The Friesner Herbarium is a systematic collection of over 100,000 dried, pressed and preserved plant specimens.  The Herbarium, third largest in the state, grew out of the personal collections of Dr. Ray C. Friesner, Professor and Chair of the Botany Department, 1920-1952.  Many students and other Butler faculty have contributed plants through the years.  The specimens, with their carefully documented labels, comprise a reference library on historical distribution, habitats, and timing of flower and fruit production.  The collection's voucher specimens serve to verify plant identification.\n \nAlthough the Herbarium contains plants from around the world, the collection emphasizes plants of Indiana.  The collection has samples of 96% of the approximately 2500 taxa of native Indiana plants.  Multiple specimens are present for most plants, providing more information than single drawings or photographs from books to assist in learning what a plant looks like.  Most of our collections were made during the first half of the century and now constitute documentation of Indiana's historical vegetation.  They also provide information on the habitat (e.g., woods, swamp, prairie) where plants were collected and would likely be found again.",

            "collection_description": "The collection of fishes includes over 30,000 catalogued lots representing 34 families, primarily of North American freshwater fishes. Groups best represented are North American minnows (Cyprinidae), catfishes (Ictaluridae), darters (Percidae), sunfishes (Centrarchidae), and suckers (Catostomidae).The collection dates to the 1920’s, with specimens collected by early expeditions of the Museum of Zoology and Department of Zoology under the direction of A. I. Ortenburger. The particular strength of the collection is in its holdings of extensive samples of fishes throughout the lower Great Plains, with emphasis on Oklahoma streams and reservoirs. Periods with strong collecting efforts include the 1920s, 1950s-1960s, and 1980s to the present. The collection grew substantially in recent years with the addition of long-term samples of fish from sites statewide by the late Mr. Jimmie Pigg. We continue to add actively to the holdings of the range by virtue of ongoing research by the curators and their graduate students and by continued archiving of community samples by the Department of Environmental Quality, whose employees continue the work begun by Mr. Pigg.\n\nThe Division of Ichthyology houses the largest and most comprehensive collection of archived specimens of fishes for Oklahoma. These collections comprise an invaluable resource for documenting historical ranges, present distributions, and ecology of Oklahoma fishes. These collections allow analysis of range contraction, human-induced changes, and conservation status of the fish fauna of Oklahoma. The availability of long-term series provides an important opportunity to assess natural variation in fish communities.\n\nThe majority of the collection is in fluid storage in archival museum jars, with limited holdings of larger specimens in steel tanks. In addition, there is a teaching collection that includes cleared and stained material, prepared skeletons, and representatives of the fish fauna world-wide both freshwater and marine.",

            "collection_description": "The collection of mammals of the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle (MNHN) started during the XVIIIth century. The collection grows regularly with specimens collected during scientific expeditions and animals from zoological parks (Zoo de Vincennes, Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes, Parc de la Haute-Touche) or care centers.\nThe collection is constituted by skeletons (mounted or not), skins (mounted or not), casts, specimens or organs in fluid (alcohol or formalin), and tissues.\nThe database ZAC (acronym for “Zoology, Comparative anatomy”) exists since 2010. It is the result of the merger of MAMMALIA (former collection of “Zoologie, Mammifères et Oiseaux”) and ANATOMIC (former collection of “Anatomie comparée”). For many groups, computerization is at a preliminary stage, and most entries have not yet been checked for errors or verified against the collections.\nMore detailed information can be obtained by writing to the curators and collection managers.\nThe database will help you prepare loan requests or visits to the collection.

The braconid collection is of world-scope, having received samples from all continents except Antarctica and is primarily used to describe new species and conduct molecular phylogenetics studies. Major recent projects include the Thailand Biodiversity Project (TIGER), the Columbia Biodiversity Project, and the Hymatol Project (phylogeny of Hymenoptera).

A very large portion of the bryophytes (about 6000 specimens) is on permanent loan to MO (Missouri Botanic Garden).&lt;hr&gt; Special collections include a definitive collection of the genus Dahlia, which contains holotypes and isotypes plus a thoroughly documented array of hybrids between authenticated wild species. A second important collection is of Arbutus that also includes type material. The troublesome genus Agrimonia is more completely documented at DEK than at any other herbarium in the world. DEK presently maintains exchange relationships with more than 26 domestic and 6 foreign herbaria. As a consequence, coverage, while emphasizing the flora of Illinois, is worldwide.",

Steve's contributions to the field of lichenology have been documented in a series of research reports and publications, and have been cited by others in a number of related studies. He has also prepared a photo gallery of Stubble Lichens Under the Microscope and bibliographies of The Lichen Literature of Maine and The Lichen Literature of New Hampshire. The University of Maine at Fort Kent's Lichen Herbarium (UMFK) houses the largest collection of lichens in Maine. It includes the largest collection of calicioid lichens and fungi in northeastern North America as well as the world's largest assemblage of lichens from the old-growth forests of northeastern North America's Acadian Forest Ecoregion. Field data for the entire collection is currently being downloaded into a comprehensive Lichen Database designed and implemented by Steve's colleague, Raymond Albert, Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maine at Fort Kent.

All collections except the birds collection and the mammals collection rank within the 15th largest in North America.  These collections, some of which date back over 150 years, represent the most complete record of Illinois biota anywhere.  Most collections are also global in geographic coverage for many groups.\nBecause these specimens document the presence of species through time, our collections are an invaluable resource for tracking changes in species distributions as habitats have been modified.  The collections are regularly used in scientific research to recognize threatened and endangered species, determine the arrival and spread of exotic and invasive species, provide baseline data for ecological restoration projects, evaluate habitat quality over time and space, assess the effects of climate change, locate populations of medical or economic importance, resolve evolutionary relationships, discover new species, and facilitate species identification through comparative morphology and DNA barcoding.  Many specimen records are available online through web-based searchable databases accessible to scientists, resource managers, policy makers, and the public.",

Field collections of habitats thought to contain tardigrades were made throughout the Long Term Ecological Research Sites  (LTER’s) in the United States from 2007 – 2012.  Other areas, both nationally and internationally were opportunistically sampled.  Samples were processed at Fresno City College with identifications being done by FCC undergraduate students, supervised by Dr. Randy Miller, and Carl Johansson, with DNA being done at BYU on selected samples. Over 15,000 tardigrades were collected and processed during that time.  Slides are distributed between FCC’s Robinson – Winter Museum of Natural History, Bohart Museum, and the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences.",

An active collecting program adopted by both past and current faculty, staff and students in the University of Connecticut's Department of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology (EEB) has enriched the collections at CONN with a wealth of specimens from many world regions, which serve as a critical foundation for diverse scientific research activities. Notably, our specimen resources represent one of the most important research collections of native New England plants and include an excellent representation of the region's imperiled and invasive species. The CONN Herbarium, in conjunction with EEB, promotes the use of its collections as educational resources in plant biology.",

Prior to the 1980s the collection contained approximately 8,000 herpetological specimens.  By the end of the decade more than 30,000 specimens were housed in the collection.  During the 1990s the size of the collection increased at an almost exponential rate.  During this time, the collection grew to contain more than 80,000 specimens.  This combined with efforts from  faculty and students helped to establish national and international recognition for the collection.  Since the turn of the century the herpetology collection at the University of Texas at Arlington has experienced more growth and the collection now houses some 115,000 specimens and is among the top herpetological collections in the United States.  In 2004 the entire herpetological collection was moved from the basement of the Life Sciences building to the newly constructed Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center.\n     Asides from housing a major herpetological collection, the Department of Biology at the  University of Texas at Arlington has hosted and facilitated the academic pursuits of a diverse student body.  This has also provided inherent benefits to the museum collection as well.  The collection currently holds the worlds largest assemblage of reptiles and amphibians from Guatemala as well as significant holdings from Texas, Bolivia, Cameroon, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guyana, Honduras, and Mexico.  Along with several thousand fluid preserved specimens, the collection maintains several type specimens, a sizeable osteological collection, cleared and stained specimens, audio recordings of frog calls, one of the largest collections of herpetological photographs in the United States, as well as a comprehensive herpetological library.  These resources can be made available for use by qualified individuals.  For questions regarding the use of the collection resources please call 817-272-2406.",

Thousands of specimens have been added from other areas of North and South America in the past few decades. The collection contains representatives from 48 of the 50 states and many countries including: Angola, Antigua, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, England, Guyana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Trinidad Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. The geographic scope of the collection is about 58% from Illinois, 28% from elsewhere in North America, 13% from South America, and 1% from the rest of the world, including Antarctica.",

There are both dry \n\t\t\tand alcohol-preserved lots. Some sea cucumber specimens are preserved as microscopic preparations \n\t\t\ton slides. The number of lots is estimated at 500,000, of which 0.4% are types. Echinoderms have \n\t\t\tbeen collected in all oceans, at all latitudes. The largest numbers of specimens were collected \n\t\t\trelatively recently in the Indo-West Pacific. Echinoderms live exclusively in marine waters and at \n\t\t\tall depths. For 25 years intensive research programs have permitted huge collections to be obtained, \n\t\t\tespecially from the Indo-Pacific and Antarctic regions. Most of the data entered so far are from \n\t\t\tthese regions.",

As a large and comprehensive holding of arthropods, predominately insects, in the Southern Rocky Mountains, it is a major resource for regional and national biodiversity investigations. Much of the material has been identified by specialists to the specific level. Examples of the unique quality of material include the aphids, other Homoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and all aquatic orders. It serves as the repository for arthropod inventories of several National Parks including Canyonlands, Great Sand Dunes, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Dinosaur, and Yucca House and Colorado National Monuments.",

The Entomology collection contains over 950,000 specimens, with Coleoptera (750,000+ specimens) and Lepidoptera (130,000+ specimens) as primary foci. The holdings include at least 18 primary types and 150 paratypes, and dates of collection span from 1878 to the present. The dung beetle collection is the largest in the United States, and our scarab holdings are particularly strong in African as well as regional material. The Colorado Scarab Survey and the Colorado Microlepidoptera Survey, both long-term projects initiated and conducted by DMNS, are steadily growing our regional holdings and our knowledge of the Colorado fauna. The Arachnology collection, with over 55,000 vials of specimens and specimen lots, is the sixth largest in the United States. Holdings are particularly strong in Colorado species and in Solifugae, with 13 primary types and 65 paratypes. The Colorado Spider Survey, initiated at DMNS and now in its 15th year, has vastly expanded our knowledge of the Colorado spider fauna. At the end of 2014, the Entomology collection moved to a new, state-of-the-art collections facility in the south wing of the museum; the Arachnology collection will be moving to the new facility in 2015.",

In the years following, the next State Botanist, Homer House, and other mycologists added to this number. The collection now contains more than 90,000 specimens. However, the importance of the collection is not in the number of specimens it contains, but, rather, in the type specimens of American fungi collected during the early years of American mycology. It is especially rich in Agarics and other larger fungi. Some of the other collectors represented in the herbarium of the New York State Museum are G. F. Atkinson, M. E. Banning, E. Bartholomew, M. J. Berkeley, E. A. Burt, G. W. Clinton, M. C. Cooke, M. A. Curtis, J. Dearness, J. B. Ellis, W. R. Gerard, E. C. Howe, J. H. Haines, H. W. Harkness, E. W. D. Holway, C. H. Kauffman, W. A. Murrill, P. A. Saccardo, S. J. Smith, and C. J. Sprague. In addition to specimens, the Museum holds numerous original drawings and paintings of fungi by Charles Peck, Mary Banning, and others plus an extensive file of correspondence covering the formative years of American mycology. Non-type specimens are available on loan to recognized scientific institutions for taxonomic research. Requests for samples of type specimens for genetic and morphological analyses are considered on a case-by-case basis.",

Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The geographic scope of our bird specimens is global, representing 38 countries. As in all of our collections, the emphasis is on Colorado species (over 80% represented) with material dating from the early 1800s to the present. Nearly 6,000 specimens were donated by the Colorado College Museum in Colorado Springs in the 1960s. This material includes the collection of Charles E. Aiken, a pioneer ornithologist in Colorado, and dates back to 1805. The Bird collection is also home to several specimens of iconic extinct species such as Passenger Pigeons and Carolina Parakeets.",

The collection includes 93 primary types and approximately 1,600 lots of secondary types representing 563 species. Also in the collection are 5,825 specimens of disarticulated and articulated skeletons representing 875 species. Especially notable are historic collections of large and important marine fishes as well as rapidly growing collections of freshwater fishes from Southeast Asia. In 2006, the museum expanded its program to archive frozen tissue samples with a newly established UF Genetic Resources Collection. Tissues of fishes are stored in -20ºC freezers and number 4,150 samples of 900 species. All specimens and tissues are databased online and available for loan.",

            "collection_description": "The National Science Foundation has announced a new grant to provide funding for a nationwide, publicly accessible database of mushrooms and related fungi. Including mushrooms, porcini, puffballs, club fungi, conks, morels, stinkhorns, truffles and cup fungi, these organisms play a critical role in the lives of plants and animals, including humans. Some are gastronomical delights, others are deadly poisonous, and all serve as nature’s recyclers, returning nutrients to the soil through decomposition. Scientists in the U.S. have been studying macrofungi for the past 150 years, resulting in a legacy of approximately 1.4 million dried scientific specimens conserved in 35 institutions in 24 states. Through this project, led by Drs. Barbara M. Thiers and Roy E. Halling of The New York Botanical Garden, these treasures will be virtually liberated from their museum cabinets and shared on-line through the Mycology Collections Portal and through many other on-line collections databases such as The Garden’s Virtual Herbarium. The database created by this project will enable a national census of these critically important organisms, and allow researchers to better understand the relationship between macrofungi and other organisms.",

The majority of specimens are eggs and larvae, with 7.7 million specimens in 103,000 lots. There are 380,000 juvenile and adult specimens in 52,000 lots, representing some 4,076 species in 1,386 genera and 328 families.  All specimens are stored in glass jars or stainless steel tanks containing 70% ethanol preservative. Tissue samples are available for over 5000 lots representing 800 species.  There are 38 primary and 318 secondary type specimens in the collection.  Approximately 324 lots of cleared and stained specimens, representing 203 species in 63 families, are also available. These are stored in full strength glycerin and maintained separately from the main collection. These skeletal preparations are augmented by an extensive library of X-rays of North Pacific fishes.

Specimens are being continually acquired by the museum, and the collections are growing by 1-2%/year. Many skeletons of birds and mammals have been prepared to accompany the more traditional skin collections. Especially noteworthy are the largest collections of herps and bird eggs in the Northwest and, until very recently, the largest collection of mammals in the Northwest. The bird wing collection is also of special significance, as a fifth of the bird specimens in the collection have been prepared since 1990 and thus have associated wings. Because it contains series of many species of vertebrates from throughout western North America, the Slater is an excellent source of material for the study of geographic variation.",

The collection has an emphasis on freshwater fishes of the central United States and also has significant marine and estuarine collections. The fish collection has representation from 3171 taxa (297 families and 1262 genera) and 79 countries including Ecuador, Fiji, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua and various marine localities. The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.</br></br>\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette & Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region's fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.</br></br>\n\nThe Ichthyology collection comprises whole, wet, voucher specimens in 70% ethanol (98%), specimens maintained as dry skeletons (0.3%) and cleared and stained preparations in glycerine (1.7%). Other ancillary collections include a large slide and digital image collection of specimens and locations (some of which are linked to specimen records through the database), a large field note collection and a map collection.</br></br>\n\nThe wet specimens are housed in a state-of-the-art fluid collection facility, opened in 1996. The facility has 2,400 square feet of collection storage space on four floors and is shared with Herpetology, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Entomology and Invertebrate Zoology. The collection storage environment is maintained at 65°F year-round by an HVAC system. Specimens are housed in state of the art glassware and stainless steel tanks and protected by a sprinkler fire suppression system and UV-shielded lighting. The division has both morphological research facilities and a shared molecular systematic laboratory.",

            "collection_description": "The collection of mammals of the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle (MNHN) started during the XVIIIth century. The collection consists of skeletons (mounted or not), skins (mounted or not), casts, specimens or organs in fluid (alcohol or formalin), and tissues, belonging to different classes and orders.\nThe database ZAC (acronym for “Zoology, Comparative anatomy”) exists since 2010. It is the result of the merger of MAMMALIA (former collection of “Zoologie, Mammifères et Oiseaux”) and ANATOMIC (former collection of “Anatomie comparée”). For many groups, computerization is at a preliminary stage, and most entries have not yet been proofed for errors or verified against the collections. Acronym ZM is used for Mammals, ZO for birds and ZA is used for the other classes present in the collection: Reptiles, Amphibians and Fishes.\nMore detailed information can be obtained by writing to the curators and collection managers.\nThe database will help you prepare loan requests or visits to the collection.

In addition, a small Ascomycete collection with emphasis on Discomycetes is present. The collection has been a pivotal part of the program of teaching and research in mycology over the past from 1970 through 2005. With the retirement of Dr. Orson K. Miller, the mycological collection entered a static stage in terms of growth. In 2012, the bulk of the collection was transferred to the New York Botanical Garden with 5000 specimens from the Southeastern United States remaining at VPI. Many collections are complemented by fresh notes, color transparencies and black and white negatives. A Microsoft Access database contains nearly 15,000 records, including all specimens currently housed at VPI. The mycological herbarium is participating in the Macrofungi Collections Consortium Digitization Project during 2013-2014 and will be available online at a later date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Prior to being moved to the New York Botanical Garden, the collection contained an estimated 29,500 specimens. Geographical coverage included major collections from Virginia and the Appalachian region, central Idaho and northwestern Montana. In addition, an Alaskan collection numbered more than 6000 with emphasis on arctic and alpine tundra fungi. Major foreign collection were from Europe, Western Australia, Republic of Korea and from The Greater Antilles, especially Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. Additional collections came from Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Thailand. Those interested in consulting specimens from outside the SE United States region should contact the New York Botanical Garden.",

Over 75% of the pinned collection has been databased; approximately 10% of the wet collection has been databased. At least one specimen of every lowest identification, in both the pinned and wet collections, has been databased so we have a complete online taxon inventory of the collection. 61,099 specimens have been identified to the species level - these represent 2,354 species (23% are apparent new records for the state).

Other countries with substantial representation include Laos, Vietnam, and Gabon, and the international focus of the collection is expanding. Important recent acquisitions include large collections from Duke and Virginia Commonwealth Universities, the University of North Carolina’s Institute of Marine Sciences, and the personal collection of the late E. E. Brown of Davidson College. The collection houses fluid-preserved specimens, skeletons, skins, tissues for molecular analyses, and other materials.

            "collection_description": "The Valdosta State University Herbarium (VSC) provides a repository for the preservation of voucher specimens that document the flora of the Coastal Plain region of Georgia and specimens from a broader geographical area that might be useful in the study of the flora of this region and that enable specialized research on particular groups of plants carried out by faculty and students in residence at Valdosta State University and by taxonomic specialists at other institutions. VSC also provides specimens for use in teaching, and its staff responds to requests from the general public, natural resource managers, agricultural scientists, and others by providing information about plants and service determinations of unknown plants and, where appropriate, preserving vouchers relating to such. In 2009 the Valdosta State University Herbarium established a SQL database, with assistance from the VSU Division of Information Technology, and in 2011 obtained support from the National Science Foundation (DBI 1054366, R. Carter PI) that enabled the purchase of imaging and other digitization equipment and the employment of student assistants to begin capturing images and building a database.  More than 70,000 specimens have been digitized.  In 2012, the Valdosta State University Virtual Herbarium (VSU-VH), a collaborative project between the Herbarium and the VSU Odum Library, was made possible with funding from the Valdosta State University Faculty Research Fund (M. Holt PI, R. Carter Co-PI).  The VSU-VH serves on-line vascular plant specimen images and data, and images and data from more than 4,000 non-vascular plant specimens are served through the Consortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria (CNABH) portal. \n\n\nVSU Virtual Herbarium http://herb.valdosta.edu/ \n\nConsortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria http://bryophyteportal.org/portal/index.php",

            "collection_description": "The Orthoptera collection is part of the Polyneoptera collection of the MNHN, which includes Orthoptera, Dictyoptera, Dermaptera and Phasmatodea, together with a diverse assemblage of so-called “small orders” (Embioptera, Psocoptera, Plecoptera, Zoraptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The Polyneoptera collection has been assembled continuously since the beginning of the XIXth century, through the activity of many French and foreign Entomologists. At the beginning of 2012, it includes some 935 000 specimens, mostly dried and pinned, including 29 000 identified types, and incorporates regularly 2 to 3 000 specimens per year, including a variable number of new type specimens. Orthoptera represent more than 85 % of the Polyneoptera collection.\nThe MNHN Orthoptera collection is particularly rich for Acridoidea originating from the Neotropics, French-speaking Africa and Madagascar, but also for Eumastacoidea and Gryllidea from the whole World. The best represented geographic regions are the Neotropics, Africa, Madagascar and New Caledonia. Occasional research programs and biological surveys lead to the rapid increase in the Collection richness for diversity hot spots (Vanuatu, the Comoros, India, Indonesia, MADANG expedition in New Guinea, etc, not mentioning French Guyana and the French West Indies).\nSince several tens of years, the Orthoptera collections has been enriched by the research activities performed at the MNHN for both Caelifera and Ensifera. These include intensive sampling in the Tropics, specimen identifications, taxa descriptions, and documentation of taxa biological attributes and behaviours. The main research axes have been the ecology and evolution of Orthopteran communities, mostly in the perspective of forest regeneration and fragmentation, phylogenetic analyses, and the evolution of biological attributes (invasive tendencies, diet and distributions in Caelifera, habitats and communication modalities in Ensifera). \nRecent studies in the evolution of acoustic communication contributes to the development of the MNHN Sound Library, which associates preferentially acoustic data with recorded specimens preserved in MNHN collections.\nThe collection is progressively computerized. Specimens are photographed by S. Poulain and G. Lecorvec.",

In 1988, at President Altmans direction, the University expanded the Arboretum to include a 5-acre (2.0 ha) Cypress dome, an oak hammock of about 3 acres (1.2 ha), and about 15 acres (6.1 ha) of sand pine and Florida scrub, connected to the original Arboretum by a saw palmetto (Sabal palmetto) community and increasingly rare Florida longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) flatwoods. Currently, the official Arboretum Boundary encompasses approximately 82 acres (33.2 ha). The original Arboretum director was Dr. Henry O. Whittier, a professor in the Biology Department who remained director until his retirement 2003. Dr. Martin Quigley was director from 2003-2009.",

            "collection_description": "The Herpetology Division and its collection of amphibians and reptiles is one of the research units of the Texas Natural History Collections (TNHC) in the Texas Natural Science Center (TNSC) at The University of Texas at Austin. The collection consists of 85,000 cataloged specimens, including skeletons and larvae.  The collection contains 2061 species from 808 genera (95 families).  It is one of the largest regional collections in the southwestern United States, and also has significant holdings from Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The collection is particularly strong in frogs; for example, the worldwide representation of toads (Bufo) compares favorably with collections such as the Smithsonian Institution.  For its size, the collection is also very strong in phrynosomatid lizards and hemidactyline salamanders.\n\nThe TNHC is modestly comprehensive, incorporating all major groups of amphibians and reptiles but lacking numerous families (non North-American taxa).  The major strengths of the collection to date fall into five categories: 1) extensive series from certain parts of the U.S. (e.g., Pseudacris, hemidactyline salamanders), 2) substantial worldwide collections of the genus Bufo, 3) certain historically important and likely irreplaceable specimens (e.g., Blanco Blind Salamander [Eurycea robusta]), 4) deep and dense chronological representation, especially from central Texas and the Texas Panhandle, and 5) over 650 open reel analog tap recordings of frog calls recorded in the field between 1950 and 1983 from various locations around the world.  \n\nOur Texas holdings comprise 56% of the total collection, from 247 of the 254 Texas counties.  We have holdings from 47 other U.S. states (only missing specimens from Maine and Rhode Island) as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands.  Worldwide, we have herpetological holdings from 85 additional countries, including substantial collections from Central and South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Holdings of extinct or extirpated species include Bufo periglenes and specimens of Opheodrys vernalis collected from Texas populations.  Thirty-seven species in the TNHC are stated listed as threatened or endangered, and 18 are federally listed as threatened or endangered.\n\nThe skeletal collection consists of both dry, and cleared & stained skeletal preparations.  There are just under 1000 dry skeletal specimens (mostly Bufonidae) and over 1200 cleared and stained specimens.\n\nThe earliest cataloged herpetology specimens date from 1939 (specimens received in exchange from the University of Florida), with a handful of specimens collected in the early to mid 1940’s.  Initial collection growth coincided with the large-scale trips organized by Blair between 1949-1955 to west Texas and the Panhandle, as well as many local and regional (particularly east Texas) collecting trips by Blair and his students; Blair was hired in 1946, became Professor in 1955 and Emeritus Professor in 1982, passing away on 09 February 1984.  Large and consistent growth to the collections continued through the mid 1970’s through the work of by Blair and his large number of students.  Blair’s contributions to science include five books (three with sole authorship), 148 papers (119 had sole authorship), supervised 100 Dissertations and Theses.   Collection growth waned for a decade but again increased following the hiring of a curator of herpetology, David Cannatella, in 1990. \n\nIn 2000, the TNHC received 18,000 specimens from the TTU herpetology collection, representing the largest collection of herpetological specimens from the Texas Panhandle.  Although this was the single largest separate herpetology collection accessioned by the TNHC, other smaller collections have been acquired, including a collection of 199 specimens from Dr. Norman Richard of Brownsville TX and 890 specimens donated by Dr. Thomas Scanlon, formerly at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  \n\nThe collection contains 496 type specimens (18 primary and 478 secondary) of 37 taxa.  All types are stored in 70% non-denatured ethanol, save two prepared as dry skeletons and seven prepared as cleared and stained specimens.\n\nCurators Cannatella and LaDuc and UT graduate students continue to add important material to the collections, most recently from the U.S., Southeast Asia, and Central and South America.",

Exchange between Gray and J. D. Hooker, the De Candolles and others resulted in the deposition in the Gray Herbarium of isotypes or syntypes of taxa from around the world described by Gray's European contemporaries. Many early or important individual collections are deposited in the Gray Herbarium. In recent years the New World representation in the Herbaria has grown through staff collections",

Specimens from Colorado and the surrounding plains, plateaus, and basins are the strength of our collection. The UCM Egg & Nest Collection contains over 2,250 egg sets and nests. Nearly three-quarters of this collection was assembled by distinguished naturalists Denis Gale and G. Morrison in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. These historic specimens represent much of the avifauna found in Colorado and several Midwestern states, and are accompanied by detailed field notes. An additional 600 egg sets collected in the US and Peru in the late 1970s-1990s are preserved as broken fragments, historically used to examine variation in eggshell gas exchange in montane and lowland habitats.",

Approximately 83% of the collection consists of specimens from the southeastern U.S., 15% from the circum-Caribbean and 2% from elsewhere (e.g., Antarctica).  Of the Florida fossils 70% are of Pliocene and Pleistocene age representing the richly fossiliferous late Neogene (e.g., Tamiami Formation (including Pinecrest Beds) and the Jackson Bluff, Intracoastal, Caloosahatchee, and Nashua formations). Eocene material collected in central to northern Florida (e.g., Avon Park Formation and Ocala Limestone) and Oligocene and Miocene fossils from around the state (e.g., Marianna and Suwannee limestones, Parachucla, Peace River, Arcadia, Chipola, and Shoal River formations) are well represented. \n\nThe collection is composed of five main parts: Systematic Collection (TX), Stratigraphic Collection (ST), Teaching Collection (TE), Micropaleontology Collection (MS), and Type and Figured Collection (TP).   The largest component is the Systematic Collection, where specimens are housed in phylogenetic order by family, then alphabetically by genus, then species.  The Stratigraphic Collection consist of fossils collected in situ.  The collection is organized by location, then formation and beds/horizons.  The Teaching Collection contains material from the Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras. It serves as a resource to educators demonstrating life’s diversity throughout the ages.  The Micropaleontology Collection contains primarily foraminifera and ostracods; both highly valuable for use in stratigraphy and paleoecology.  The type and figured collection contains specimens cited in scientific publications and is organized alphabetically beginning with species.\n  \nThe strength and significance of our IP Collection resides in the extensive amount of material collected within the last 50 years from over 6,000 sites. Our collections are unique in that they represent many localities no longer accessible due to rapid regional land development. They are also a significant national research resource that serves as the basis, for an active and productive IP Research Program.  The entire IP collection (fully cataloged and uncataloged) consists of over 500,000 specimen lots.  A conservative estimate would place the total number of specimens in the IP Collection at about 6.0 million with over 2.6 million fully curated, computer cataloged, and available online.  As indicated, the number of uncataloged specimens outnumber the cataloged specimens. This reflects both continuous acquisition of material over long periods prior to 1986 when little curation occurred, an active IP field program that began in 1986, and the arrival of numerous, sizable donations (e.g., University of Alabama's Maxwell Smith Collection, Florida State University's Geology Department Collection, Rollins College's Beal-Maltbie Collection, the Florida Geological Survey Collection, Tulane University's E. & H. Vokes Collection, and the collections of Paul and Thomas McGinty, Muriel Hunter and Joe Banks, Victor Zullo, Ernest and Evelyn Bradley, Howard and Miriam Schriner, Jules DuBar, Richard Petit, Sue Stephens, Mary Palmer, Lyle Campbell, Joe Carter, and William Lyons).",

It contains a good representation of the flora of the midwestern United States, but most of its specimens were collected in Illinois. Students and faculty conducting ecological studies and floristic inventories use the herbarium to help identify the plants they see and collect. Students in Plant Taxonomy, Dendrology, and Wetland Plants classes use it to become familiar with species and for identification of specimens. In the Wetland Plants, General Botany, Ethnobotany, and Plant Morphology classes, herbarium specimens are used to to make morphological comparisons among relevant plant taxa. The herbarium was started in 1899. Originally named the Stover Herbarium for Dr. Ernest L. Stover, professor of botany from 1923-1960, the Botany Dept. faculty voted in 1995 to &quot;expand&quot; the name to honor John E. Ebinger on the occasion of his retirement. Dr. Ebinger collected about half the specimens in the collection and served as curator from 1963-1995. For information about vascular plants and bryophytes, contact Dr. Gordon C. Tucker (gctucker@eiu.edu); for fungi and lichens, contact Dr. Andrew S. Methven (asmethven@eiu.edu).",

In addition, the collection consists of approximately 4000 specimens of fungi and slime molds, which include nearly all of the South Dakota state records. The extant vascular plant collection includes a limited number of specimens from around the world; including collections by A. Eastwood, P.O. Schallert, L.S. Rose, J.A. Calder, B.C. Tharp, W.H. Duncan, A.E. Radford, J.M. Gillet, C.G. Pringle, O. Degner, P.A. Munz, E.J. Palmer, K. Biswas, and B. Rosengurtt. Other important collections include those of F.L. Bennett (former BHSC Curator) and M.L. Kravig (Orchidologist). BHSC is also home to one of the largest collections of Miocene age plant fossils from the Great Plains of North America, with at least 10,000 fossils housed from throughout the Great Plains. Type collections of several fossil species from J.R. Thomasson and M.L. Gabel are held in the collection. Grasses (Poaceae), hackberries (Celtis, Ulmaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae) and borages (Boraginaceae) are well represented.",

Macrofungal collections were first accessioned in 1980 by Dr. Timothy J. Baroni and his students and continue to be the bulk of the newly added collections to the herbarium. Macrofungi (Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes) of Upstate New York, and especially the Adirondack Park, are well represented, with collections also from the Southeastern United States, the Gulf Coastal States and California. Collections from Europe (mainly from the Alps), the Greater and Lesser Antilles (Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, St. John USVI, Trinidad), Central America (Belize and Costa Rica), South America (Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela), Mexico and to a lesser extent Thailand and Tasmania are also important components of the research materials curated at Cortland.",

The major strengths of the collection, amphibians from the southeastern United States and both reptiles and amphibians from the Northeast, reflects the intensive collection by the Wrights. Much of the material collected by the Wrights in New York and Georgia is not duplicated elsewhere. The last 15 years have been seen important acquisitions for the collection. To complement our traditional strength in North American taxa, we have made a concerted effort to obtain foreign material, especially synoptic series representing geographic areas. Through collecting, exchanges and acquisition of other various collections we now have good representation of Costa Rican viperids, lizards from Western and South Australia, amphibians and reptiles from Puerto Rico, snakes and lizards from Mexico, and a more representative collection of African and European species.",

The museum's mission was to document and describe Wyoming's avian biodiversity. There was a brief period of active collecting by Knight and Charles W. Gilmore in 1897 and 1898. This was followed by a period of inactivity until the arrival of Ernest Pilsbury Walker as an undergraduate. He collected specimens around the southeastern part of the state from 1910 through 1912. He also contributed his personal collection from Sheridan, Indiana. Beyond sporadic trading and salvaging, the collection has been mostly inactive for the past 100 years until Matt Carling was hired as curator and James Maley was hired as collections manager. The collection was moved into the Berry Center and organized, and it is now undergoing rapid expansion.",

The collection began to be formed towards the middle of the 19th century and still contains types of some species described from this period by authors like Audouin, Savigny, Gervais and Guérin-Ménéville. The collection was considerably augmented during the period 1880‒1910 by E. Simon, who described numerous species either collected by himself or received through his extensive network of correspondents. During the 20th century scorpions were studied at the museum by Fage and by his successor, M. Vachon. Since the 1970s, systematic activity on the collection has continued intensively through the work of W. Lourenço, who was a student of Vachon. As a result, the collection is both large and rich, containing an unusually high proportion of type material. In addition to material studied by authors working at the museum, a significant part has come from outside sources, either through gift or exchange. Thus it also contains material studied by authorities such as R.I. Pocock, T. Thorell, K. Kraepelin, W.D. Sissom and V. Fet. The scorpion collection is worldwide in scope, but the best represented regions are tropical South America, North Africa, the Middle East, Western Africa, Madagascar and Southeast Asia. It contains over 9000 lots, including about 700 types, preserved in 80 % alcohol and stored in the museum’s Zoothèque. The collections are made available to external researchers, either through loans or visits, at the discretion of the curator. In cases where neither is feasible, photographic documentation of specimens may be provided on request.",

The collection was established before 1800 \nwith the collections of the explorer naturalists (voyages of Bougainville, Savigny, Dumont D'Urville ...) and then continued, \nnotably with those of the Travailleur and the Talisman. The collection has benefited from the work of prestigious scientists \nlike Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Latreille, H. and A. Milne-Edwards, and Chevreux. \nThe specimens, measuring 1 mm to over 2 m in size, are mainly preserved in alcohol. Some are kept dry \n(old collections such as the historical collection of crabs), others as slide preparations. \nThe collection includes worldwide material of marine, freshwater and terrestrial crustaceans (including pest species).\nThe collection grows 1 to 1.5% per year on average, varying according to the group, thanks to numerous donations and deposits. \nFor 25 years the \"Tropical Deep-Sea Benthos\" (formely MUSORSTOM) expeditions have resulted in the largest collection \nin the world from the deep-water (bathyal) environment.",

In 1988, at President Altmans direction, the University expanded the Arboretum to include a 5-acre (2.0 ha) Cypress dome, an oak hammock of about 3 acres (1.2 ha), and about 15 acres (6.1 ha) of sand pine and Florida scrub, connected to the original Arboretum by a saw palmetto (Sabal palmetto) community and increasingly rare Florida longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) flatwoods. Currently, the official Arboretum Boundary encompasses approximately 82 acres (33.2 ha). The original Arboretum director was Dr. Henry O. Whittier, a professor in the Biology Department who remained director until his retirement 2003. Dr. Martin Quigley was director from 2003-2009.",

The collection includes 364 type specimens, making it the fourth largest collection of such specimens in the US. Karyotype (chromosome) preparations are available for ca. 4,000 rodent specimens. These consist of slides of chromosome preparations and, in some cases, black and white photos and/or 35 mm negatives of chromosome spreads. The mammal collection also houses large series of lab-raised specimens from research by Francis B. Sumner, Richard D. Sage, and William Z. Lidicker.",

            "collection_description": "The CUMV Bird Collection contain a record of the development of ornithology at Cornell from the earliest days of Arthur A. Allen and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Dr. Arthur A. Allen, on the faculty at Cornell from 1915–1953, made the name Cornell nearly synonymous with ornithology in the United States. Allen contributed many birds to the collection, and possibly even more importantly, attracted a very large number of students interested in birds. His numerous students contributed specimens from their research and travels all over the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other parts of the world. The CU collection contain many specimens collected by of Cornell faculty such as George M. Sutton, Charles Sibley, William Dilger, and Tom Cade, but also contains student specimens of Dean Amadon, Walter Bock, F. Graham Cooch, John Emlen, Herbert Friedmann, Ludlow Griscom, Harry Hann, Robert Mengel, Eugene Morton, Ralph Palmer, Kenneth Parkes, Olin S. Pettingill, Alan Phillips, Austin Rand, James Rising, Lester Short, Stanley Temple, Harrison Tordoff, David Wingate, as well as many others. The CUMV Bird Collection currently consists of approximately 38,300 round skins, 700 flat skins, 1,000 spread wings, 5,500 skeletons, 1,400 fluid-preserved specimens, 3,200 egg sets, 590 nests, and 1,000 uncataloged mounts. Approximately 350 of the skeletons have an associated flatskin, and approximately 150 round skins have a separate spread wing.",

            "collection_description": "The Illinois Natural History Survey Crustacean Collection is one of the largest state collections of crustaceans in North America. A few specimens now housed in the collection were collected in the late 1800's by Stephen A. Forbes. They formed the basis for the first article to appear in the Survey's Bulletin \"List of Illinois Crustacea.\" More specimens were collected during the first half of the 1900's in conjunction with the insect surveys organized by Herbert H. Ross. A large part of the collection comes from specimens collected from 1972 to 1982 for Lawrence M. Page's \"The Crayfishes and Shrimps (Decapoda) of Illinois\" published in 1985. Since that time, significant collections have been made documenting the spread of invasive crayfishes in Illinios and surveying the states of Kentucky and Alambama. We've also recently acquired a statewide collection of Missouri crayfishes. Holdings - The collection contains primary types of nine species and secondary types of 5 species. The collection contains over 91,000 specimens and 12,100 lots of approximately 350 species in 30 families. Almost all are from North America. About 50% of the collection is from Illinois; the remainder is mostly from the southeastern United States. The best represented groups are crayfishes, shrimps, scuds, slaters, and pill bugs.  A few lots of marine crustaceans found along the North American coastline are also present in the collection. We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998.",

There are an estimated 5,000 type specimens. The collection is particularly rich in ferns, bryophytes and grasses, as well as in historically important materials from the early botanical collectors. In addition, it was the herbarium of record for the flora of southern New England from 1864 until 1955, when that function passed to the University of Connecticut at Storrs.",

These represent 1,067 genera and 5,323 species of which 13,818 specimens are skeletons. 99.9% of specimens are identified to genus, and 96% of specimens are identified to species. This includes 472 Primary Type specimens (representing 424 taxa) and 5,515 Paratypes (representing 804 taxa). The average growth over the last ten years has been nearly 1500 specimens per year. The auxiliary research collections contain 2,145 radiographs, 7,288 kodachrome slides, and 10,789 frozen tissue samples. All of the above mentioned collections have been inventoried and the data associated with them have been entered into computer databases in Filemaker Pro. A collection of 37 audio tapes containing hundreds of recordings of anuran vocalizations has been digitized and can now be accessed via the Division's webpage, as well as catalogue records and digital images of all primary type specimens.",

Today, the Department of Mammalogy houses over 275,000 specimens, making it the third largest collection of recent mammals in the world. The scientific mission of the Department of Mammalogy is to describe the diversity of living and recently extinct mammals and to explore the mechanisms responsible for their evolution and extinction. In fulfillment of this objective, the department collects, archives and studies specimens of recent mammals and the data associated with those specimens. We aim always to provide the highest standards of curatorial care and to promote access to the collections by other scholars. The collections are visited by an average of 130 researchers every year, and the Department loans over 500 specimens a year to researchers around the globe.\nThe Recent Mammals Collection, together with the remarkable collection of books, journals, and manuscripts of the Department Library and Archives provides scholars with outstanding resources for research in mammalian systematics, biodiversity and evolutionary biology.",

This diversity of sources continues today, but large expeditions have been very important \nfrom the late eighteenth century through to the colonial era, a role they continue to play to this day. \nThe \"Tropical Deep-Sea benthos\" oceanographic expeditions (formerly MUSORSTOM), launched in the early 1980s to sample the benthos of the \ntropical South and West-Pacific, have resulted in the collection becoming the best in the world for deep-sea faunas \n(100-1.500 m bathymetric zone).

            "collection_description": "Established in the second half of the 19th century, the MNHN’s collections of myriapods and onychophorans are still stored as one collection, mostly for historical and practical reasons.\n\nThe myriapods section is a major collection for myriapodology worldwide, all the groups it includes, and its history. The material comes from all around the world and belongs to the classes Pauropoda (2 extant orders), Symphyla, Chilopoda (5 extant orders) and Diplopoda (16 extant orders), collected from most of the terrestrial ecosystems. About 5000 species of myriapods are represented in the collections, including a high number of historical samples. The myriapods collection comprises 300 000 to 400 000 specimens. Nearly half of it constitutes the reference collection, the other half, which includes a potentially important amount of taxa yet unknown to science, is awaiting further studies. The reference collection gathers about 25 000 to 30 000 batches, each containing from 1 to more than 300 specimens, stored into 4639 jars. The reference collection includes about 3 000 to 3 500 batches containing altogether 15 000 to 20 000 type specimens.\nTo date, the MNHN-MY dataset has gathered 9 795 batches of myriapods, consisting of 63 617 specimens, which represents 33% to 40% of the reference collection.\n\nThe Onychophorans collection, contains invaluable historical material, such as type specimens of species described by Bouvier in the 1900s. The MNHN’s collection of Onychophorans (commonly known as velvet worms) is one of the world’s most important for this group. Although only a small phylum, it is of key importance in several aspects within the Metazoa, particularly regarding phylogenetic relationships between arthropods and other invertebrates (Oliveira & al. 2012). The collection boasts almost a hundred species, represented by 202 batches containing 279 specimens and 43 dissections. This collection is stored into 67 jars. It includes 56 batches containing altogether 73 nomenclatural types (plus 2 dissections of types).\nThis part of the collection is fully databased and included in the MNHN-MY dataset, and has been since used for studies on the group (Oliveira & al. 2012).",

            "collection_description": "Two databases concern the bird collections of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle de Paris.\nThe database AVES covers skins and mounted specimens, but the collection includes also eggs, nests and alcoholic preparations. Today, this collection numbers some 180 000 specimens, including approximately 2500 types. Search results follow Howard and Moore Checklist (updated to corrigenda) and taxonomic sequence. The upper geographical rank conforms to the ISO 3166-1 code. Undetermined locality does not necessarily mean that the information is no available, but that its validity has not yet been checked. This and others additional information are sometime accessible by consulting label photographs that we progressively add to the database.\nThe database ZAC (acronym for “Zoology, Comparative anatomy”) exists since 2010. It is the result of the merger of MAMMALIA (former collection of “Zoologie, Mammifères et Oiseaux”) and ANATOMIC (former collection of “Anatomie comparée”). This database concerns skeletons (mounted or not) and fluid preserved specimens (formalin).\nMore information can be obtained by writing to the curators and collection managers. The database will help you prepare loan requests or visits to the collection. For any request contact: http://colhelper.mnhn.fr/",

The group was once considered quite rare, but the application of appropriate techniques for its capture has become the most frequent description of new species in recent years. The ricinuleid have extremely thick cuticle and habits of slow locomotion (Platnick, 2002), which makes your viewing rather limited in active collections, as immobile, to be confused with the substrate they occupy. Species Ricinulei seem conservative, with very similar external morphology (Tourinho & Saturnino, 2010) and some species give the impression of a morphological mosaic of different species.",

Tissues associated with any of these preparation types are noted as a separate field in our database.  Because there are active public education and exhibits programs in the KU Natural History Museum, a few of our specimens are taxidermy mounts (BM) and some are housed permanently on exhibit.  Other preparation types are coded as “other” (OT).  Occasionally, specimens are prepared with the baculum or os clitoris and separately stored in preserving fluid.  Non-standard preparation types and additional materials are noted in a comments field in our database.<br><br>\n\n\nWe have extensive historical collections from Central America, Mexico, and southeast, central, western regions of the United States and Alaska.  We recently added outstanding collections from the Philippines and New Guinea.  We anticipate continuing to maintain our strengths in these geographic regions, emphasizing bats, rodents and insectivores—current taxonomic strengths.  Most of our collection consists of nicely prepared skins, skulls, and complete skeletons, with most recent specimens accompanied by tissues.<br><br>\n\nThere are 135 type specimens in our collection at present.  Of these, the largest number (97) are rodents.  There are also 6 insectivore, 25 bat, 5 lagomorph, and 2 carnivore holotypes.  Lists of the Mammalogy's type specimens have been published by Jones and Genoways (1969) and Jones et al. (1984), although several have been described since.  Types have been described from Barbados, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (14 states), Mozambique, Nicaragua, Philippines, Venezuela, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and from 12 states in the U.S.  All type specimens are kept in the designated \"type case\" at all times.  Use of type specimens must be arranged with the curators.<br> <br>\n\nThere is broad taxonomic coverage, including important holdings of Central and South American marsupials, insectivores, bats, rodents; Holarctic shrews, microtines, squirrels and North American bats, insectivores, carnivores, rodents and lagomorphs.",

The paleontology collection houses both vertebrate and invertebrate specimens, ranging from Cambrian archaeocyathids to Quaternary mammals. Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.",

            "collection_description": "Vertebrate Zoology in the CU Museum of Natural History is a biodiversity repository of more than 120,000 specimens from five taxa: Fishes, Amphibians and Reptiles (Herpetology), Birds, and Mammals. With the exception of birds, our collections are the largest collections of their kind in Colorado. Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. The Mammal collection includes over 16,000 specimens with representation from twenty-five countries, with the majority of specimens from Colorado (nearly 70%) and other western states. Specimens are typically preserved as a set of a study skin and an extracted skull, although large mammals are also prepared as hides, taxidermy, and skeletons. Many people have added to the mammal collection over the years, including the pioneer Colorado naturalist, Edward Royal Warren (3,000+ specimens), Donald A. Spencer, Dallas A. Sutton, Leslie Viereck, and emeritus professor and former Museum Director, David M. Armstrong. E.R. Warren's archive of field notes and photographs are an invaluable resource for documenting distributions and changes of Colorado mammals in the first three decades of the 20th century.",

The dried skin and skeletal preparations are stored in 732 metal cabinets. These cabinets are specially designed to keep the specimens safe from UV light, dust, occasional insect pests, and other harmful agents. Every specimen is labeled with information concerning its species, sex, collector, preparator, collecting location, and other pieces of collecting data. Each specimen has also been given a catalog number and its data verified and entered into a searchable computer database. All specimens of the same species are stored together, organized by country, state, county, and finally catalog number. Groups of related species are housed in adjacent cases. As with the Genetic Resources Collection, the majority of these specimens in this collection are bar coded and a project is underway to bar code the rest to facilitate the retrieval of associated data and to reduce time and effort spent by the NSRL staff in maintaining an organized collection.",

            "collection_description": "History: The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  See \"A History of Herpetology in Illinois\" for more information on early herpetologists in Illinois.\n\nHoldings: The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study \"The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,\" published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).\n\nFrozen Tissues: We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above. The search engine will deliver limited location information.",

The specimens come from around the world. They are mainly preserved in 75% alcohol in glass jars with some preparations on microscope slides. All specimens whether or not the types are located in two places: a large general reserve of the Museum, the zoothÃ¨que, and a smaller reserve in a research building. About 26,000 species of spiders, some 12,000 types (mixed in the entire collection) are represented in the Museum. This represents a number of individuals estimated to be approximately 2 million. Started in the 1860s by EugÃ¨ne SIMON, the collection has grown significantly over the years with substantial collections in number of specimens (including a large part of the material remaining to be studied and identified) from other arachnologists or naturalists, among them Bonnet, Denis, Dresco Legendre or Strand ... This collection has a predominantly scientific vocation. It grows with some specimens to several hundred per year with donations mainly from current collections. The main domains of research activity related to this collection are systematic, with two major axes, taxonomy and biosystematics, but also applications in the management of biodiversity and the environment as well as expertise. The loan service of the collection is of great importance each year along with hosting of visitors and sending material. Databasing began in the 2000s. Are currently integrated into the general database of the Museum some 3,000 lots spiders. The sources of information related to this collection are also based on manual files easily available to visitors and on a library with historical reference books as well as most recent reprints.",

As a biologically diverse area that lies at the junction of four ecosystems (Central and Mohave Basins as well as Wasatch and Colorado Plateaus), the approximately 8000 current specimens mirror an array of ecological and economical changes that have occurred in the southern Basin. In addition to historical documentation, specimens housed in the SUU Herbarium serve as a teaching tool for our students. The SUU Herbarium is also the official repository for Parashant National Monument (National Park Service).",

As a result of his research, the herbarium contains one of the most comprehensive collections of the genus Braya (Brassicaceae) outside of Canada and the genus Draba (Brassicaceae) in the Intermountain Region. The herbarium has extensive Utah collections from the deserts of the San Rafael Swell, high elevation mountain peaks in along the Wasatch Front (i.e. Mt. Timpanogos, Mt. Nebo) and the Deep Creek Range. Recently, vouchers from Dr. Renee Van Buren's book, Woody Plant of Utah, have been processed and integrated into the herbarium. Currently the herbarium houses over 17,000 accessioned herbarium sheets, with an average of 1,500 specimens being added to the collection each year. The current curator, Dr. Jason A. Alexander, is a specialist in desert floras, specifically the Mojave Desert and the Great Basin, and the genus Astragalus (Fabaceae).",

            "collection_description": "The herpetological collection at the UW Burke Museum contains over 8,000 specimens of amphibians and reptiles. The collection has particularly strong geographic representation of the Pacific Northwest. More than 2,200 specimens are forest-dwelling amphibians from Western Washington obtained during wildlife studies in the 1980s and early 1990s. About 900 are garter snakes collected during the mid-1900s. In 2010, Dr. Adam Leache joined the Burke Museum as Curator of Genetic Resources and Herpetology. The entire collection was inventoried, catalogued, and georeferenced. This transition made the Burke Herpetology data searchable and mappable to the public for the first time. The geographic scope of the collection has expended greatly since 2010, and new collections from Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Ghana are now available that reflect active research programs by herpetology staff. The collection consists largely of alcohol-reserved specimens with a small number of photographs and skeletons. Genetic resources are available for all specimens collected since 2010.",

ALA contains more than 235,000 specimens of vascular and non-vascular plants. Data for the Vascular Plant and Cryptogam collections are managed separately in Arctos. Most lichen collections in the ALA date from the early post WWII period, after the Alcan (now Alaska Highway) was completed, including specimens from John Thomson’s first of two Alaska expeditions in 1958 on the Arctic Slope as well as his 1967 expedition along the Alaska Highway. The contributions of three other people, H. Persson and W. C. Steere (bryophytes) and H. Krog (lichens), further strengthened the foundation for ALA’s cryptogamic collections. Barbara Murray’s collecting started in the 1970s just after the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay on the arctic coast of Alaska. Use of helicopters became frequent and as a result Murray has collected large number of specimens at over 250 Alaskan localities. The ALA cryptogamic collection has recently been supported by two NSF grants (NSF- 1023407: Toward Documenting Biodiversity Change in Arctic Lichens: Databasing the Principal Collections, Establishing a Baseline, and Developing a Virtual Flora (with University of Wisconsin) and NSF NSF-1115056: TCN Collaborative Research: North American Lichens and Bryophytes: Sensitive Indicators of Environmental Quality and Change) to help with digitization of specimen data and taking care of large backlogs of specimens. The majority of the cryptogam collections are from Alaska, while numerous collections are also from Russia, Fennoscandia, Canada and the lower 48 United States.",

Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (26,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), and the Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites). Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to \"holistic vouchers\" containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites. Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 130,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970's. Serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas are associated with 37,000 specimens. The MSB houses an extensive archive of field journals and catalogues that date to the 1900's and are associated with specimens held in the collection.

The records in the Reptile and Amphiphibian database were transcribed from these catalogues. Most entries have not yet been checked for errors or verified against the collections. Thus there is a great heterogeneity in taxonomy and in geographical information. Beside the individual labelling system, the collection uses numbers to store specimens according to their specific name. This allows attaching to this number various historical names and the valid one. Locality names are written usually in French transliteration. Our curators and collection managers can help users concerning these issues.\nSearch results will give only part of the information available on the database. They help the researchers to learn about the holdings of the collection and the gross geographical origin. More detailed information can be obtained by writing to the curators. The results should not be used as primary data without check back to the specimens. The issue of the database is to prepare loan requests or visits to the collection.

Many of our earliest specimens were collected by well-known researchers such as David Starr Jordan, Carl Eigenmann, Charles Frederick Hartt and Seth Meek. By 1935, the collection contained only 3,000 lots, but during the following 35 years, Edward Raney and his students built the finest collection of eastern North American freshwater fishes in existence today. In Collette and Lachner's (1976) report on fish collections in the United States and Canada, the CUMV Fish Collection ranked thirteenth among all collections and fourth among National Resource Centers in North America. Although there is worldwide representation of both marine and freshwater species, the bulk of the collection is strongly representative of freshwater fishes from eastern North America and has formed the basis for numerous systematic works on the North American fish fauna. Much of the material is in large geographic series, and many sites have been sampled repeatedly through extended periods of time. Some specimens are from the original New York State Biological Survey (1926–1939). Many of our collections are from the highly industrialized Northeast and Middle Atlantic states and thus document earlier faunas in habitats now greatly altered, and we have repeated samples through time from many of these localities. The primary activities for the last several years has been collection building efforts directed toward African freshwater fishes.",

ALA contains more than 235,000 specimens of vascular and non-vascular plants. Data for the Vascular Plant and Cryptogam collections are managed separately in Arctos. Much of our understanding of Ice Age Beringia is based on botanical specimens, the largest collection of which is housed at ALA. Our recent acquisition from Iowa State University of the J. P. Anderson Collection (32,000 specimens on permanent loan) forms a significant part of this story. This collection of arctic and boreal plants, which contains 67 nomenclatural type specimens, formed the basis for much of Andersonâ€™s seminal work, The Flora of Alaska. The botanical collection also includes plants from other states, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia, Japan, and Russia and provides a basis for teaching and research. Our botanical collection can be viewed and searched through the Arctos database and includes high resolution images of 163,000 herbarium sheets, online representation of 190,000 holdings, and inclusion of all holdings in an object-tracking system (barcode labeling).",

The major strengths of the collection, amphibians from the southeastern United States and both reptiles and amphibians from the Northeast, reflects the intensive collection by the Wrights. Much of the material collected by the Wrights in New York and Georgia is not duplicated elsewhere. The last 15 years have been seen important acquisitions for the collection. To complement our traditional strength in North American taxa, we have made a concerted effort to obtain foreign material, especially synoptic series representing geographic areas. Through collecting, exchanges and acquisition of other various collections we now have good representation of Costa Rican viperids, lizards from Western and South Australia, amphibians and reptiles from Puerto Rico, snakes and lizards from Mexico, and a more representative collection of African and European species.",

These document the distribution and natural variation of the 2,400 species of flowering plants, ferns, conifers, and cycads found in northern Florida-one of North America's biodiversity hotspots-and the microalgae of Florida’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Each plant specimen is carefully identified, pressed, dried, and mounted to archival standards, with accompanying data on where and when it was collected. The specimens are a valued resource to local, state, national, and international biologists studying plant and microalgae systematics, ecology, evolution, biogeography, conservation biology, anatomy, and morphology. New specimens are added to the collection each week. As of May 2014, the collection includes all specimens from Stetson University's Herbarium (DLF). In August 2003, Austin Mast became the new director of the herbarium. Though now retired, Loran Anderson remains active in the herbarium. The current curator is Chris Buddenhagen.\n\nIn August of 2003 the Robert K. Godfrey Herbarium set up a digital imaging system and SQL database. Currently 79,705 of our 220,000+ specimens have been entered into the herbarium's database. In late 2010, Tall Timbers Research Station's Herbarium began serving specimen data and images on this site as well. Currently, data and images for 10,344 of Tall Timbers Research Station's 10,000+ herbarium specimens are being served. Specimen images and data from both institution's can be searched by following the database links on our menu or by clicking here.",

Research strengths include: Paleozoic and Mesozoic fishes, Paleozoic tetrapods, Mesozoic marine vertebrates, Cenozoic small mammals and Natural Trap Cave fauna.",

It will treat the North American biota utilizing collections within the USA. Not only is the size of the problem tractable, but also nearly all of the collections relevant to the United States biota reside within the United States, with substantial amounts of material from Canada and Mexico also being available in US institutions. The TTD will be coordinated by seven collaborating institutions. Each possesses necessary taxonomic expertise, proven leadership skills, and the ability to form networks with another 27 large and small institutions, to capture and deliver specimen data for organisms in all three trophic levels.",

Today the collections number around 250,000 specimens including ca. 70 type specimens with over 50% of the material from Wisconsin and another 30% from the rest of North America. The collections are divided into vascular (107,000 records) and nonvascular (17,000 records) plants with associated data digitized.",

The egg and nest collection contains over 14,000 items, including over 12,800 egg sets, 220 nests, and 900 egg-nest combinations. The size of this collection ranks it as one of the largest such collections in North America. Eggs of nest parasites (e.g., cowbirds) are present in approximately 120 sets, and 150 egg sets or nests are associated with catalogued bird specimens. Eggs in this collection range in size from the tiny eggs of hummingbirds (0.2 grams) to the gigantic eggs of the extinct elephant bird (9 kilograms). Approximately 80-90% of the specimens are accompanied by original collector data slips and by photographs of sets taken in the museum, both of which are digitally linked to the record online. These data slips contain information on collecting locality, date, clutch size, incubation, identification, nest composition, and nest placement.",

Resources are available to scientists to help better understand amphibian and reptile biology and conserve species when their existence is threatened. The great diversity of amphibian and reptile species is preserved for scientific research in the form of alcohol-preserved and skeletal specimens. The herpetology collection holds over 76,000 catalogued specimens (73,300 fluid-preserved specimens and 3,100 skeletons with 212 primary and 500 secondary types) dating back to the 1890s. The collection has been built over the past century and is actively being added to today. All cataloged specimens are computer databased which allows for any combination of taxonomic and geographic records to be searched.",
